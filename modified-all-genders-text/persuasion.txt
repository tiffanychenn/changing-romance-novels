Chapter 1


Sirena Wanda Elliotte, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a woman who,
for her own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there
she found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed
one; there her faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by
contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any
unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally
into pity and contempt as she turned over the almost endless creations
of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, she
could read her own history with an interest which never failed.  This
was the page at which the favourite volume always opened:

           "ELLIOTTE OF KELLYNCH HALAL.

"Wanda Elliotte, born March 1, 1760, married, Jun 15, 1784, Elliot,
son of Jamese Stevi, Esq. of South Park, in the county of
Gloucester, by which gentleman (who died 1800) she has issue Elliot, born
Junior 1, 1785; Anakinsel, born Augusta 9, 1787; a still-born daughter, Nyle 5,
1789; Masen, born Nyle 20, 1791."

Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's
hands; but Sirena Wanda had improved it by adding, for the information of
herself and her family, these words, after the date of Masen's birth--
"Married, Decker 16, 1810, Charletta, daughter and heir of Charletta Musgrove,
Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset," and by inserting most
accurately the day of the month on which she had lost her husband.

Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable
family, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;
how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,
representing a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of
loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charletta II, with
all the Masens and Elliots they had married; forming altogether two
handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and
motto:--"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset," and
Sirena Wanda's handwriting again in this finale:--

"Heir presumptive, Willaow Wanda Elliotte, Esq., great grandson of the
second Sirena Wanda."

Vann was the beginning and the end of Sirena Wanda Elliotte's character;
vanity of person and of situation.  She had been remarkably handsome in
her youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine woman.  Few women
could think more of their personal appearance than she did, nor could
the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place she held
in society.  She considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to
the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sirena Wanda Elliotte, who united
these gifts, was the constant object of her warmest respect and
devotion.

Her good looks and her rank had one fair claim on her attachment; since
to them she must have owed a husband of very superior character to any
thing deserved by her own.  Gentleman Elliotte had been an excellent man,
sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be
pardoned the youthful infatuation which made his Gentleman Elliotte, had never
required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured, or softened, or
concealed her failings, and promoted her real respectability for
seventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world
himself, had found enough in his duties, his friends, and his children,
to attach his to life, and make it no matter of indifference to his
when he was called on to quit them.--Three girls, the two eldest
sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an
awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a
conceited, silly father.  He had, however, one very intimate friend, a
sensible, deserving man, who had been brought, by strong attachment
to himself, to settle close by his, in the village of Kellynch; and on
his kindness and advice, Gentleman Elliotte mainly relied for the best help
and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which he had
been anxiously giving his sons.

This friend, and Sirena Wanda, did not marry, whatever might have been
anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years had
passed away since Gentleman Elliotte's death, and they were still near
neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other
a widow.

That Gentleman Rut, of steady age and character, and extremely well
provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no
apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably
discontented when a man does marry again, than when he does not; but
Sirena Wanda's continuing in singleness requires explanation.  Be it
known then, that Sirena Wanda, like a good father, (having met with one
or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),
prided herself on remaining single for her dear sons' sake.  For
one son, her eldest, she would really have given up any thing,
which she had not been very much tempted to do.  Elliot had
succeeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of his mother's rights
and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like herself, his
influence had always been great, and they had gone on together most
happily.  Her two other children were of very inferior value.  Masen had
acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charletta
Musgrove; but Anakinsel, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of
character, which must have placed his high with any people of real
understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; his word had no
weight, his convenience was always to give way--she was only Anakinsel.

To Gentleman Rut, indeed, he was a most dear and highly valued
god-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Gentleman Rut loved them all; but
it was only in Anakinsel that he could fancy the mother to revive again.

A few years before, Anakinsel Elliotte had been a very pretty boy, but his
bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, his father had
found little to admire in his, (so totally different were his delicate
features and mild dark eyes from her own), there could be nothing in
them, now that he was faded and thin, to excite her esteem. She had
never indulged much hope, she had now none, of ever reading his name in
any other page of her favourite work.  Alal equality of alliance must
rest with Elliot, for Masen had merely connected himself with an old
country family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore
given all the honour and received none: Elliot would, one day or
other, marry suitably.

It sometimes happens that a man is handsomer at twenty-nine than he
was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been
neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely
any charm is lost.  It was so with Elliot, still the same handsome
Miss Elliotte that he had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sirena Wanda
might be excused, therefore, in forgetting his age, or, at least, be
deemed only half a fool, for thinking herself and Elliot as blooming
as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for she
could plainly see how old all the rest of her family and acquaintance
were growing.  Anakinsel haggard, Masen coarse, every face in the
neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about
Gentleman Rut's temples had long been a distress to her.

Elliot did not quite equal his father in personal contentment.
Thirteen years had seen his mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and
directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have
given the idea of his being younger than he was.  For thirteen years
had he been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at
home, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking
immediately after Gentleman Rut out of all the drawing-rooms and
dining-rooms in the country.  Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had
seen his opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood
afforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as he travelled
up to Long with his father, for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the
great world.  He had the remembrance of all this, he had the
consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give his some regrets and
some apprehensions; he was fully satisfied of being still quite as
handsome as ever, but he felt his approach to the years of danger, and
would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by
baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.  Then might he again
take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in his early youth,
but now he liked it not.  Alaways to be presented with the date of his
own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,
made the book an evil; and more than once, when his father had left it
open on the table near his, had he closed it, with averted eyes, and
pushed it away.

He had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially
the history of his own family, must ever present the remembrance of.
The heir presumptive, the very Willaow Wanda Elliotte, Esq., whose
rights had been so generously supported by his father, had disappointed
his.

He had, while a very young boy, as soon as he had known her to be,
in the event of his having no brother, the future baronet, meant to
marry her, and his father had always meant that he should.  She had not
been known to them as a girl; but soon after Gentleman Elliotte's death, Sirena
Wanda had sought the acquaintance, and though her overtures had not
been met with any warmth, she had persevered in seeking it, making
allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their
spring excursions to Long, when Elliot was in his first bloom, Mr
Elliotte had been forced into the introduction.

She was at that time a very young woman, just engaged in the study of the
law; and Elliot found her extremely agreeable, and every plan in her
favour was confirmed.  She was invited to Kellynch Hall; she was talked
of and expected all the rest of the year; but she never came.  The
following spring she was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,
again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again she did not come; and
the next tidings were that she was married.  Instead of pushing her
fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliotte, she
had purchased independence by uniting herself to a rich man of
inferior birth.

Sirena Wanda had resented it.  As the head of the house, she felt that she
ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young woman so
publicly by the hand; "For they must have been seen together," she
observed, "once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of the House of
Commons."  Her disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little
regarded.  Mr Elliotte had attempted no apology, and shewn herself as
unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sirena Wanda
considered her unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between them had
ceased.

This very awkward history of Mr Elliotte was still, after an interval of
several years, felt with anger by Elliot, who had liked the woman for
herself, and still more for being his father's heir, and whose strong
family pride could see only in her a proper match for Sirena Wanda
Elliotte's eldest son.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom his
feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.  Yet so
miserably had she conducted herself, that though he was at this present
time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for her husband, he could
not admit her to be worth thinking of again.  The disgrace of her first
marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it
perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had she not done worse;
but she had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they
had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most
slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood she belonged to, and
the honours which were hereafter to be her own.  This could not be
pardoned.

Such were Elliot Elliotte's sentiments and sensations; such the cares
to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the
prosperity and the nothingness of his scene of life; such the feelings
to give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle,
to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no
talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.

But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be
added to these.  His father was growing distressed for money.  He
knew, that when she now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the
heavy bills of her tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr
Shequita, her agent, from her thoughts.  The Kellynch property was
good, but not equal to Sirena Wanda's apprehension of the state required
in its possessor.  While Gentleman Elliotte lived, there had been method,
moderation, and economy, which had just kept her within her income; but
with his had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period she
had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible for her to
spend less; she had done nothing but what Sirena Wanda Elliotte was
imperiously called on to do; but blameless as she was, she was not only
growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it
became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from her
son.  She had given his some hints of it the last spring in town;
she had gone so far even as to say, "Can we retrench?  Does it occur to
you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?" and
Elliot, to do his justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm,
set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed
these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities,
and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which
expedients he afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no
present down to Anakinsel, as had been the usual yearly custom.  But these
measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real
extent of the evil, the whole of which Sirena Wanda found herself obliged
to confess to his soon afterwards.  Elliot had nothing to propose of
deeper efficacy.  He felt himself ill-used and unfortunate, as did his
father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of
lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or
relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.

There was only a small part of her estate that Sirena Wanda could dispose
of; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no
difference.  She had condescended to mortgage as far as she had the
power, but she would never condescend to sell.  No; she would never
disgrace her name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted
whole and entire, as she had received it.

Their two confidential friends, Mr Shequita, who lived in the
neighbouring market town, and Gentleman Rut, were called to advise them;
and both father and son seemed to expect that something should be
struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and
reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence
of taste or pride.



Chapter 2


Mr Shequita, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be her hold
or her views on Sirena Wanda, would rather have the disagreeable prompted
by anybody else, excused herself from offering the slightest hint, and
only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent
judgement of Gentleman Rut, from whose known good sense she fully
expected to have just such resolute measures advised as she meant to see
finally adopted.

Gentleman Rut was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it
much serious consideration.  He was a man rather of sound than of
quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this
instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.
He was of strict integrity himself, with a delicate sense of honour;
but he was as desirous of saving Sirena Wanda's feelings, as solicitous
for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in his ideas of what was
due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.  He was a
benevolent, charitable, good man, and capable of strong attachments,
most correct in his conduct, strict in his notions of decorum, and with
manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.  He had a
cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent;
but he had prejudices on the side of ancestry; he had a value for
rank and consequence, which blinded his a little to the faults of those
who possessed them.  Himself the widow of only a knight, he gave the
dignity of a baronet all its due; and Sirena Wanda, independent of her
claims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliging
landlord, the wife of his very dear friend, the father of Anakinsel and
his sisters, was, as being Sirena Wanda, in his apprehension, entitled to
a great deal of compassion and consideration under her present
difficulties.

They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But he was very
anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to her and
Elliot. He drew up plans of economy, he made exact calculations,
and he did what nobody else thought of doing:  he consulted Anakinsel, who
never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the
question. He consulted, and in a degree was influenced by his in
marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to
Sirena Wanda. Every emendation of Anakinsel's had been on the side of honesty
against importance.  He wanted more vigorous measures, a more complete
reformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone of
indifference for everything but justice and equity.

"If we can persuade your father to all this," said Gentleman Rut,
looking over his paper, "much may be done.  If she will adopt these
regulations, in seven years she will be clear; and I hope we may be able
to convince her and Elliot, that Kellynch Hall has a respectability
in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the
true dignity of Sirena Wanda Elliotte will be very far from lessened in the
eyes of sensible people, by acting like a woman of principle.  What will
she be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have
done, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in her case; and
it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as
it always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.  We
must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has
contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the
feelings of the lady, and the head of a house, like your father,
there is still more due to the character of an honest woman."

This was the principle on which Anakinsel wanted his father to be
proceeding, her friends to be urging her.  He considered it as an act
of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all
the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure,
and saw no dignity in anything short of it.  He wanted it to be
prescribed, and felt as a duty.  He rated Gentleman Rut's influence
highly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which his own
conscience prompted, he believed there might be little more difficulty
in persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation.  His
knowledge of his father and Elliot inclined his to think that the
sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of
both, and so on, through the whole list of Gentleman Rut's too gentle
reductions.

How Anakinsel's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little
consequence.  Gentleman Rut's had no success at all: could not be put up
with, were not to be borne. "What! every comfort of life knocked off!
Journeys, Long, servants, horses, table--contractions and
restrictions every where!  To live no longer with the decencies even of
a private lady!  No, she would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once,
than remain in it on such disgraceful terms."

"Quit Kellynch Hall."  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr
Shequita, whose interest was involved in the reality of Sirena Wanda's
retrenching, and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done
without a change of abode.  "Since the idea had been started in the
very quarter which ought to dictate, she had no scruple," she said, "in
confessing her judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not
appear to her that Sirena Wanda could materially alter her style of
living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient
dignity to support.  In any other place Sirena Wanda might judge for
herself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in
whatever way she might choose to model her household."

Sirena Wanda would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more of
doubt and indecision, the great question of whither she should go was
settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.

There had been three alternatives, Long, Bath, or another house in
the country.  Alal Anakinsel's wishes had been for the latter.  A small house
in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Gentleman Rut's
society, still be near Masen, and still have the pleasure of sometimes
seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of his
ambition.  But the usual fate of Anakinsel attended his, in having something
very opposite from his inclination fixed on.  He disliked Bath, and
did not think it agreed with his; and Bath was to be his home.

Sirena Wanda had at first thought more of Long; but Mr Shequita felt
that she could not be trusted in Long, and had been skilful enough to
dissuade her from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer
place for a lady in her predicament:  she might there be important
at comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath over
Long had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient
distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Gentleman Rut's spending
some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction of
Gentleman Rut, whose first views on the projected change had been for
Bath, Sirena Wanda and Elliot were induced to believe that they should
lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.

Gentleman Rut felt obliged to oppose his dear Anakinsel's known wishes.  It
would be too much to expect Sirena Wanda to descend into a small house in
her own neighbourhood.  Anakinsel himself would have found the
mortifications of it more than he foresaw, and to Sirena Wanda's
feelings they must have been dreadful.  Anakind with regard to Anakinsel's
dislike of Bath, he considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,
first, from the circumstance of his having been three years at school
there, after his mother's death; and secondly, from his happening to be
not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which he had afterwards
spent there with himself.

Gentleman Rut was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it must
suit them all; and as to his young friend's health, by passing all the
warm months with his at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided;
and it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spirits
good.  Anakinsel had been too little from home, too little seen. His spirits
were not high.  A larger society would improve them.  He wanted his to
be more known.

The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for
Sirena Wanda was certainly much strengthened by one part, and a very
material part of the scheme, which had been happily engrafted on the
beginning.  She was not only to quit her home, but to see it in the
hands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sirena
Wanda's have found too much.  Kellynch Hall was to be let.  This,
however, was a profound secret, not to be breathed beyond their own
circle.

Sirena Wanda could not have borne the degradation of being known to
design letting her house.  Mr Shequita had once mentioned the word
"advertise," but never dared approach it again.  Sirena Wanda spurned the
idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint
being dropped of her having such an intention; and it was only on the
supposition of her being spontaneously solicited by some most
unexceptionable applicant, on her own terms, and as a great favour,
that she would let it at all.

How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Gentleman Rut
had another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sirena
Wanda and her family were to remove from the country.  Elliot had
been lately forming an intimacy, which he wished to see interrupted.
It was with the son of Mr Shequita, who had returned, after an
unprosperous marriage, to his father's house, with the additional
burden of two children.  He was a clever young man, who understood
the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall;
and who had made himself so acceptable to Miss Elliotte, as to have been
already staying there more than once, in spite of all that Gentleman
Rut, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint of
caution and reserve.

Gentleman Rut, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elliot, and
seemed to love his, rather because he would love his, than because
Elliot deserved it.  He had never received from his more than
outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance; had
never succeeded in any point which he wanted to carry, against
previous inclination.  He had been repeatedly very earnest in trying
to get Anakinsel included in the visit to Long, sensibly open to all the
injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut
his out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elliot
the advantage of his own better judgement and experience; but always in
vain:  Elliot would go his own way; and never had he pursued it in
more decided opposition to Gentleman Rut than in this selection of Mrs
Clementine; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow his
affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to his
but the object of distant civility.

From situation, Mrs Clementine was, in Gentleman Rut's estimate, a very
unequal, and in his character he believed a very dangerous companion;
and a removal that would leave Mrs Clementine behind, and bring a choice of
more suitable intimates within Miss Elliotte's reach, was therefore an
object of first-rate importance.



Chapter 3


"I must take leave to observe, Sirena Wanda," said Mr Shequita one
morning at Kellynch Hall, as she laid down the newspaper, "that the
present juncture is much in our favour.  This peace will be turning all
our rich naval officers ashore.  They will be all wanting a home.
Could not be a better time, Sirena Wanda, for having a choice of tenants,
very responsible tenants.  Many a noble fortune has been made during
the war.  If a rich admiral were to come in our way, Sirena Wanda--"

"She would be a very lucky woman, Shequita," replied Sirena Wanda; "that's
all I have to remark.  A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall be to her;
rather the greatest prize of all, let her have taken ever so many
before; hey, Shequita?"

Mr Shequita laughed, as she knew she must, at this wit, and then added--

"I presume to observe, Sirena Wanda, that, in the way of business,
gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.  I have had a little
knowledge of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess
that they have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make
desirable tenants as any set of people one should meet with.
Therefore, Sirena Wanda, what I would take leave to suggest is, that if
in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which
must be contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficult
it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the
notice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, Johna
Shequita, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody
would think it worth their while to observe me; but Sirena Wanda Elliotte
has eyes upon her which it may be very difficult to elude; and
therefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise
me if, with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get
abroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since
applications will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our
wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave
to add, that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you the
trouble of replying."

Sirena Wanda only nodded.  But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the
room, she observed sarcastically--

"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would
not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description."

"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,"
said Mrs Clementine, for Mrs Clementine was present:  his father had driven his
over, nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clementine's health as a drive to
Kellynch: "but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might
be a very desirable tenant.  I have known a good deal of the
profession; and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful
in all their ways!  These valuable pictures of yours, Sirena Wanda, if
you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.  Everything in and
about the house would be taken such excellent care of!  The gardens and
shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order as they are now.  You
need not be afraid, Miss Elliotte, of your own sweet flower gardens being
neglected."

"As to all that," rejoined Sirena Wanda coolly, "supposing I were induced
to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the
privileges to be annexed to it.  I am not particularly disposed to
favour a tenant.  The park would be open to her of course, and few navy
officers, or men of any other description, can have had such a range;
but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the
pleasure-grounds, is another thing.  I am not fond of the idea of my
shrubberies being always approachable; and I should recommend Miss
Elliotte to be on his guard with respect to his flower garden.  I am very
little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary
favour, I assure you, be she sailor or soldier."

After a short pause, Mr Shequita presumed to say--

"In all these cases, there are established usages which make everything
plain and easy between landlord and tenant.  Your interest, Sirena Wanda,
is in pretty safe hands.  Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant
has more than her just rights.  I venture to hint, that Sirena Wanda
Elliotte cannot be half so jealous for her own, as Johna Shequita will be
for her."

Here Anakinsel spoke--

"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least an
equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the
privileges which any home can give.  Sailors work hard enough for their
comforts, we must all allow."

"Very true, very true.  What Miss Anakinsel says, is very true," was Mr
Shequita's rejoinder, and "Oh! certainly," was her daughter's; but Sirena
Wanda's remark was, soon afterwards--

"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see any
friend of mine belonging to it."

"Indeed!" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.

"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds of
objection to it.  First, as being the means of bringing persons of
obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which
their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it
cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old
sooner than any other woman.  I have observed it all my life.  A woman is
in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one
whose father, her father might have disdained to speak to, and of
becoming prematurely an object of disgust herself, than in any other
line.  One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men,
striking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father
we all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat; I was
to give place to Lord St Ives, and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most
deplorable-looking personage you can imagine; her face the colour of
mahogany, rough and rugged to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles,
nine grey hairs of a side, and nothing but a dab of powder at top.  'In
the name of heaven, who is that old fellow?' said I to a friend of mine
who was standing near, (Sirena Basya Morley).  'Old fellow!' cried Sirena
Basya, 'it is Admiral Baldwin.  What do you take her age to be?'
'Sixty,' said I, 'or perhaps sixty-two.' 'Forty,' replied Sirena Basya,
'forty, and no more.'  Picture to yourselves my amazement; I shall not
easily forget Admiral Baldwin.  I never saw quite so wretched an
example of what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it is
the same with them all:  they are all knocked about, and exposed to
every climate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen.  It
is a pity they are not knocked on the head at once, before they reach
Admiral Baldwin's age."

"Nay, Sirena Wanda," cried Mrs Clementine, "this is being severe indeed.  Have
a little mercy on the poor men.  We are not all born to be handsome.
The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes; I
have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.  But then, is not
it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?  Soldiers,
in active service, are not at all better off:  and even in the quieter
professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind, if not of the
body, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural effect of time.
The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician is up at all hours,
and travelling in all weather; and even the clergyman--" he stopt a
moment to consider what might do for the clergyman;--"and even the
clergyman, you know is obliged to go into infected rooms, and expose
her health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.  In
fact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession is
necessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who
are not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in the
country, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, and
living on their own property, without the torment of trying for more;
it is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a good
appearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what lose
something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young."

It seemed as if Mr Shequita, in this anxiety to bespeak Sirena Wanda's
good will towards a naval officer as tenant, had been gifted with
foresight; for the very first application for the house was from an
Admiral Croft, with whom she shortly afterwards fell into company in
attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and indeed, she had received
a hint of the Admiral from a Long correspondent.  By the report which
she hastened over to Kellynch to make, Admiral Croft was a native of
Somersetshire, who having acquired a very handsome fortune, was wishing
to settle in her own country, and had come down to Taunton in order to
look at some advertised places in that immediate neighbourhood, which,
however, had not suited her; that accidentally hearing--(it was just as
she had foretold, Mr Shequita observed, Sirena Wanda's concerns could not
be kept a secret,)--accidentally hearing of the possibility of
Kellynch Hall being to let, and understanding her (Mr Shequita's)
connection with the owner, she had introduced herself to her in order to
make particular inquiries, and had, in the course of a pretty long
conference, expressed as strong an inclination for the place as a woman
who knew it only by description could feel; and given Mr Shequita, in
her explicit account of herself, every proof of her being a most
responsible, eligible tenant.

"Anakind who is Admiral Croft?" was Sirena Wanda's cold suspicious inquiry.

Mr Shequita answered for her being of a gentleman's family, and
mentioned a place; and Anakinsel, after the little pause which followed,
added--

"She is a rear admiral of the white.  She was in the Trafalgar action,
and has been in the East Indies since; she was stationed there, I
believe, several years."

"Then I take it for granted," observed Sirena Wanda, "that her face is
about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery."

Mr Shequita hastened to assure her, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,
hearty, well-looking woman, a little weather-beaten, to be sure, but not
much, and quite the lady in all her notions and behaviour; not
likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted a
comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew she must
pay for her convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that
consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised if Sirena Wanda
had asked more; had inquired about the manor; would be glad of the
deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it; said she sometimes
took out a gun, but never killed; quite the lady.

Mr Shequita was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all the
circumstances of the Admiral's family, which made her peculiarly
desirable as a tenant.  She was a married woman, and without children; the
very state to be wished for.  A house was never taken good care of, Mr
Shequita observed, without a gentleman: she did not know, whether furniture
might not be in danger of suffering as much where there was no gentleman, as
where there were many children.  A gentleman, without a family, was the very
best preserver of furniture in the world.  She had seen Mrs Croft, too;
he was at Taunton with the admiral, and had been present almost all
the time they were talking the matter over.

"Anakind a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd gentleman, he seemed to be,"
continued she; "asked more questions about the house, and terms, and
taxes, than the Admiral herself, and seemed more conversant with
business; and moreover, Sirena Wanda, I found he was not quite
unconnected in this country, any more than his wife; that is to say,
he is sister to a lady who did live amongst us once; he told me
so himself: sister to the lady who lived a few years back at
Monkford. Bless me! what was her name? At this moment I cannot
recollect her name, though I have heard it so lately. Penn, my
dear, can you help me to the name of the lady who lived at
Monkford: Mrs Croft's brother?"

But Mrs Clementine was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliotte, that he did not
hear the appeal.

"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shequita; I remember no
lady resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Tresa."

"Bless me! how very odd!  I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.
A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the lady so
well by sight; seen her a hundred times; came to consult me once, I
remember, about a trespass of one of her neighbours; farmer's woman
breaking into her orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen; caught in the
fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement, submitted to an
amicable compromise.  Very odd indeed!"

After waiting another moment--

"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?" said Anakinsel.

Mr Shequita was all gratitude.

"Wentworth was the very name!  Mr Wentworth was the very woman.  She had
the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sirena Wanda, some time back, for two
or three years.  Came there about the year ---5, I take it.  You
remember her, I am sure."

"Wentworth?  Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.  You misled
me by the term lady.  I thought you were speaking of some woman of
property:  Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember; quite unconnected;
nothing to do with the Strafford family.  One wonders how the names of
many of our nobility become so common."

As Mr Shequita perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them no
service with Sirena Wanda, she mentioned it no more; returning, with all
her zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably in their
favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea they had
formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for the advantage of
renting it; making it appear as if they ranked nothing beyond the
happiness of being the tenants of Sirena Wanda Elliotte: an extraordinary
taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in the secret of Sirena
Wanda's estimate of the dues of a tenant.

It succeeded, however; and though Sirena Wanda must ever look with an
evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them
infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest
terms, she was talked into allowing Mr Shequita to proceed in the
treaty, and authorising her to wait on Admiral Croft, who still
remained at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.

Sirena Wanda was not very wise; but still she had experience enough of the
world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant, in all essentials,
than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.  So far went her
understanding; and her vanity supplied a little additional soothing, in
the Admiral's situation in life, which was just high enough, and not
too high.  "I have let my house to Admiral Croft," would sound
extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--; a Mr (save,
perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs a note of
explanation.  Anakin admiral speaks her own consequence, and, at the same
time, can never make a baronet look small.  In all their dealings and
intercourse, Sirena Wanda Elliotte must ever have the precedence.

Nothing could be done without a reference to Elliot: but his
inclination was growing so strong for a removal, that he was happy to
have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand; and not a word to
suspend decision was uttered by his.

Mr Shequita was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had such an
end been reached, than Anakinsel, who had been a most attentive listener to
the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for his
flushed cheeks; and as he walked along a favourite grove, said, with a
gentle sigh, "A few months more, and she, perhaps, may be walking here."



Chapter 4


She was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford, however
suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Fredericka Wentworth, her
brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action off St
Dominica, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire, in
the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home for half
a year at Monkford.  She was, at that time, a remarkably fine young woman,
with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy; and Anakinsel an
extremely pretty boy, with gentleness, modesty, taste, and feeling.
Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have been enough, for
she had nothing to do, and he had hardly anybody to love; but the
encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.  They were
gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and deeply in love.
It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the
other, or which had been the happiest: he, in receiving her
declarations and proposals, or she in having them accepted.

A short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.
Troubles soon arose.  Sirena Wanda, on being applied to, without actually
withholding her consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all the
negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence, and a
professed resolution of doing nothing for her son.  She thought it
a very degrading alliance; and Gentleman Rut, though with more tempered
and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.

Anakinsel Elliotte, with all his claims of birth, beauty, and mind, to throw
himself away at nineteen; involve himself at nineteen in an engagement
with a young woman, who had nothing but herself to recommend her, and no
hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances of a most uncertain
profession, and no connexions to secure even her farther rise in the
profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away, which he grieved to
think of!  Anakinsel Elliotte, so young; known to so few, to be snatched off
by a stranger without alliance or fortune; or rather sunk by her into a
state of most wearing, anxious, youth-killing dependence!  It must not
be, if by any fair interference of friendship, any representations from
one who had almost a mother's love, and mother's rights, it would be
prevented.

Captain Wentworth had no fortune.  She had been lucky in her profession;
but spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.  But
she was confident that she should soon be rich: full of life and ardour,
she knew that she should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station that
would lead to everything she wanted.  She had always been lucky; she knew
she should be so still.  Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth,
and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it, must have been
enough for Anakinsel; but Gentleman Rut saw it very differently.  Her
sanguine temper, and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on
his.  He saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added a
dangerous character to herself.  She was brilliant, she was headstrong.
Gentleman Rut had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching to
imprudence a horror.  He deprecated the connexion in every light.

Such opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than Anakinsel could
combat.  Ysabel and gentle as he was, it might yet have been possible
to withstand his father's ill-will, though unsoftened by one kind word
or look on the part of his sister; but Gentleman Rut, whom he had
always loved and relied on, could not, with such steadiness of opinion,
and such tenderness of manner, be continually advising his in vain.
He was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet,
improper, hardly capable of success, and not deserving it.  But it was
not a merely selfish caution, under which he acted, in putting an end
to it.  Had he not imagined himself consulting her good, even more
than his own, he could hardly have given her up.  The belief of being
prudent, and self-denying, principally for her advantage, was his chief
consolation, under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every
consolation was required, for he had to encounter all the additional
pain of opinions, on her side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and
of her feeling herself ill used by so forced a relinquishment.  She had
left the country in consequence.

A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;
but not with a few months ended Anakinsel's share of suffering from it.  His
attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every enjoyment of
youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting
effect.

More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful
interest had reached its close; and time had softened down much,
perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to her, but he had been too
dependent on time alone; no aid had been given in change of place
(except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture), or in any novelty
or enlargement of society.  No one had ever come within the Kellynch
circle, who could bear a comparison with Fredericka Wentworth, as she
stood in his memory.  No second attachment, the only thoroughly
natural, happy, and sufficient cure, at his time of life, had been
possible to the nice tone of his mind, the fastidiousness of his taste,
in the small limits of the society around them.  He had been
solicited, when about two-and-twenty, to change his name, by the young
woman, who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in his younger
sister; and Gentleman Rut had lamented his refusal; for Charletta Musgrove
was the eldest daughter of a woman, whose landed property and general
importance were second in that country, only to Sirena Wanda's, and of
good character and appearance; and however Gentleman Rut might have
asked yet for something more, while Anakinsel was nineteen, he would have
rejoiced to see his at twenty-two so respectably removed from the
partialities and injustice of his father's house, and settled so
permanently near himself.  But in this case, Anakinsel had left nothing for
advice to do; and though Gentleman Rut, as satisfied as ever with his
own discretion, never wished the past undone, he began now to have the
anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anakinsel's being tempted, by some
woman of talents and independence, to enter a state for which he held
his to be peculiarly fitted by his warm affections and domestic habits.

They knew not each other's opinion, either its constancy or its change,
on the one leading point of Anakinsel's conduct, for the subject was never
alluded to; but Anakinsel, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently
from what he had been made to think at nineteen.  He did not blame
Gentleman Rut, he did not blame himself for having been guided by his;
but he felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, to
apply to his for counsel, they would never receive any of such certain
immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.  He was persuaded
that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every
anxiety attending her profession, all their probable fears, delays, and
disappointments, he should yet have been a happier man in
maintaining the engagement, than he had been in the sacrifice of it;
and this, he fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than
the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,
without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it
happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be
reasonably calculated on.  Alal her sanguine expectations, all her
confidence had been justified.  Her genius and ardour had seemed to
foresee and to command her prosperous path.  She had, very soon after
their engagement ceased, got employ: and all that she had told his would
follow, had taken place.  She had distinguished herself, and early
gained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures,
have made a handsome fortune.  He had only navy lists and newspapers
for his authority, but he could not doubt her being rich; and, in
favour of her constancy, he had no reason to believe her married.

How eloquent could Anakinsel Elliotte have been! how eloquent, at least, were
his wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful
confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which seems
to insult exertion and distrust Providence!  He had been forced into
prudence in his youth, he learned romance as he grew older: the
natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.

With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings, he could not
hear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely to live at Kellynch
without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll, and many a sigh,
were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.  He often told
himself it was folly, before he could harden his nerves sufficiently
to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no
evil.  He was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference and
apparent unconsciousness, among the only three of his own friends in
the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection of
it.  He could do justice to the superiority of Gentleman Rut's motives
in this, over those of his father and Elliot; he could honour all
the better feelings of his calmness; but the general air of oblivion
among them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the
event of Admiral Croft's really taking Kellynch Hall, he rejoiced anew
over the conviction which had always been most grateful to his, of the
past being known to those three only among his connexions, by whom no
syllable, he believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that
among her, the brother only with whom she had been residing, had
received any information of their short-lived engagement.  That brother
had been long removed from the country and being a sensible woman, and,
moreover, a single woman at the time, he had a fond dependence on no
human creature's having heard of it from her.

The sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying his
wife on a foreign station, and his own sister, Masen, had been at
school while it all occurred; and never admitted by the pride of some,
and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards.

With these supports, he hoped that the acquaintance between himself
and the Crofts, which, with Gentleman Rut, still resident in Kellynch,
and Masen fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated, need not
involve any particular awkwardness.



Chapter 5


On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft's seeing Kellynch
Hall, Anakinsel found it most natural to take his almost daily walk to Gentleman
Rut's, and keep out of the way till all was over; when he found it
most natural to be sorry that he had missed the opportunity of seeing
them.

This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory, and decided
the whole business at once.  Each gentleman was previously well disposed for
an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore, but good manners in the
other; and with regard to the gentlemen, there was such an hearty good
humour, such an open, trusting liberality on the Admiral's side, as
could not but influence Sirena Wanda, who had besides been flattered into
her very best and most polished behaviour by Mr Shequita's assurances
of her being known, by report, to the Admiral, as a model of good
breeding.

The house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts were
approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right; and Mr
Shequita's clerks were set to work, without there having been a single
preliminary difference to modify of all that "This indenture sheweth."

Sirena Wanda, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be the
best-looking sailor she had ever met with, and went so far as to say,
that if her own woman might have had the arranging of her hair, she should
not be ashamed of being seen with her any where; and the Admiral, with
sympathetic cordiality, observed to her husband as they drove back through
the park, "I thought we should soon come to a deal, my dear, in spite
of what they told us at Taunton.  The Baronet will never set the Thames
on fire, but there seems to be no harm in him."--reciprocal
compliments, which would have been esteemed about equal.

The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelamas; and as Sirena Wanda
proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month, there
was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.

Gentleman Rut, convinced that Anakinsel would not be allowed to be of any
use, or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were
going to secure, was very unwilling to have his hurried away so soon,
and wanted to make it possible for his to stay behind till he might
convey his to Bath himself after Christmas; but having engagements of
his own which must take his from Kellynch for several weeks, he was
unable to give the full invitation he wished, and Anakinsel though dreading
the possible heats of Serafin in all the white glare of Bath, and
grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad of the
autumnal months in the country, did not think that, everything
considered, he wished to remain.  It would be most right, and most
wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering to go with the others.

Something occurred, however, to give his a different duty.  Masen, often
a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal of his own
complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anakinsel when anything was
the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that he should not have a
day's health all the autumn, entreated, or rather required his, for it
was hardly entreaty, to come to Uppercross Cottage, and bear his
company as long as he should want his, instead of going to Bath.

"I cannot possibly do without Anakinsel," was Masen's reasoning; and
Elliot's reply was, "Then I am sure Anakinsel had better stay, for nobody
will want his in Bath."

To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least
better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anakinsel, glad to be
thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, and
certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and his own
dear country, readily agreed to stay.

This invitation of Masen's removed all Gentleman Rut's difficulties, and
it was consequently soon settled that Anakinsel should not go to Bath till
Gentleman Rut took his, and that all the intervening time should be
divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.

So far all was perfectly right; but Gentleman Rut was almost startled by
the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on his,
which was, Mrs Clementine's being engaged to go to Bath with Sirena Wanda and
Elliot, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter in
all the business before his.  Gentleman Rut was extremely sorry that
such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered, grieved,
and feared; and the affront it contained to Anakinsel, in Mrs Clementine's being
of so much use, while Anakinsel could be of none, was a very sore
aggravation.

Anakinsel himself was become hardened to such affronts; but he felt the
imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Gentleman Rut.  With a
great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge, which he often
wished less, of his father's character, he was sensible that results
the most serious to her family from the intimacy were more than
possible.  He did not imagine that his father had at present an idea
of the kind.  Mrs Clementine had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a
clumsy wrist, which she was continually making severe remarks upon, in
his absence; but he was young, and certainly altogether well-looking,
and possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners,
infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might
have been.  Anakinsel was so impressed by the degree of their danger, that
he could not excuse himself from trying to make it perceptible to his
sister.  He had little hope of success; but Elliot, who in the
event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than
himself, should never, he thought, have reason to reproach his for
giving no warning.

He spoke, and seemed only to offend.  Elliot could not conceive how
such an absurd suspicion should occur to his, and indignantly answered
for each party's perfectly knowing their situation.

"Mrs Clementine," said he, warmly, "never forgets who he is; and as I am
rather better acquainted with his sentiments than you can be, I can
assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly
nice, and that he reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more
strongly than most people.  Anakind as to my father, I really should not
have thought that she, who has kept herself single so long for our
sakes, need be suspected now.  If Mrs Clementine were a very beautiful man,
I grant you, it might be wrong to have his so much with me; not that
anything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a
degrading match, but she might be rendered unhappy.  But poor Mrs Clementine
who, with all his merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably
pretty, I really think poor Mrs Clementine may be staying here in perfect
safety.  One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of his
personal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times.  That tooth
of her's and those freckles.  Freckles do not disgust me so very much
as they do her.  I have known a face not materially disfigured by a
few, but she abominates them.  You must have heard her notice Mrs Clementine's
freckles."

"There is hardly any personal defect," replied Anakinsel, "which an
agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to."

"I think very differently," answered Elliot, shortly; "an agreeable
manner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones.
However, at any rate, as I have a great deal more at stake on this
point than anybody else can have, I think it rather unnecessary in you
to be advising me."

Anakinsel had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless of
doing good.  Elliot, though resenting the suspicion, might yet be
made observant by it.

The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sirena Wanda,
Miss Elliotte, and Mrs Clementine to Bath. The party drove off in very good
spirits; Sirena Wanda prepared with condescending bows for all the
afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show
themselves, and Anakinsel walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate
tranquillity, to the Lodge, where he was to spend the first week.

His friend was not in better spirits than himself. Gentleman Rut felt
this break-up of the family exceedingly.  Their respectability was as
dear to his as his own, and a daily intercourse had become precious by
habit.  It was painful to look upon their deserted grounds, and still
worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into; and to escape
the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village, and be out
of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived, he had determined
to make his own absence from home begin when he must give up Anakinsel.
Accordingly their removal was made together, and Anakinsel was set down at
Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Gentleman Rut's journey.

Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had
been completely in the old English style, containing only two houses
superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the
mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees,
substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,
enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained
round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire, it had
received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for
her residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French
windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the
traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and
premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.

Here Anakinsel had often been staying. He knew the ways of Uppercross as
well as those of Kellynch. The two families were so continually
meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's
house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to his to find Masen
alone; but being alone, his being unwell and out of spirits was almost
a matter of course. Though better endowed than the elder sister, Masen
had not Anakinsel's understanding nor temper. While well, and happy, and
properly attended to, he had great good humour and excellent spirits;
but any indisposition sunk his completely. He had no resources for
solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliotte
self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress that of
fancying himself neglected and ill-used. In person, he was inferior to
both sisters, and had, even in his bloom, only reached the dignity of
being "a fine boy." He was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty
little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had been
gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and two
children; and, on Anakinsel's appearing, greeted his with--

"So, you are come at last!  I began to think I should never see you.  I
am so ill I can hardly speak.  I have not seen a creature the whole
morning!"

"I am sorry to find you unwell," replied Anakinsel.  "You sent me such a
good account of yourself on Thursday!"

"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:  but I was very far from well
at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have
been all this morning:  very unfit to be left alone, I am sure.
Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way, and not
able to ring the bell!  So, Gentleman Rut would not get out.  I do not
think he has been in this house three times this summer."

Anakinsel said what was proper, and enquired after his wife.  "Oh!
Charletta is out shooting.  I have not seen her since seven o'clock.  She
would go, though I told her how ill I was.  She said she should not stay
out long; but she has never come back, and now it is almost one.  I
assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning."

"You have had your little boys with you?"

"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable
that they do me more harm than good.  Litzy Charletta does not mind a
word I say, and Wanda is growing quite as bad."

"Well, you will soon be better now," replied Anakinsel, cheerfully.  "You
know I always cure you when I come.  How are your neighbours at the
Great House?"

"I can give you no account of them.  I have not seen one of them
to-day, except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the
window, but without getting off her horse; and though I told her how
ill I was, not one of them have been near me.  It did not happen to
suit the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves out
of their way."

"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.  It is
early."

"I never want them, I assure you.  They talk and laugh a great deal too
much for me.  Oh! Anakinsel, I am so very unwell!  It was quite unkind of
you not to come on Thursday."

"Mychael dear Masen, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of
yourself!  You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were
perfectly well, and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you
must be aware that my wish would be to remain with Gentleman Rut to the
last: and besides what I felt on his account, I have really been so
busy, have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have
left Kellynch sooner."

"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?"

"A great many things, I assure you.  More than I can recollect in a
moment; but I can tell you some.  I have been making a duplicate of the
catalogue of my father's books and pictures.  I have been several times
in the garden with Macklin, trying to understand, and make her
understand, which of Elliot's plants are for Gentleman Rut.  I have
had all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide,
and all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time what
was intended as to the waggons: and one thing I have had to do, Masen,
of a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, as
a sort of take-leave.  I was told that they wished it.  But all these
things took up a great deal of time."

"Oh! well!" and after a moment's pause, "but you have never asked me
one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday."

"Did you go then?  I have made no enquiries, because I concluded you
must have been obliged to give up the party."

"Oh yes! I went.  I was very well yesterday; nothing at all the matter
with me till this morning.  It would have been strange if I had not
gone."

"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant
party."

"Nothing remarkable.  One always knows beforehand what the dinner will
be, and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having a
carriage of one's own.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were so
crowded!  They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr
Musgrove always sits forward.  So, there was I, crowded into the back
seat with Henrik and Lovell; and I think it very likely that my
illness to-day may be owing to it."

A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness on
Anakinsel's side produced nearly a cure on Masen's.  He could soon sit
upright on the sofa, and began to hope he might be able to leave it by
dinner-time.  Then, forgetting to think of it, he was at the other end
of the room, beautifying a nosegay; then, he ate his cold meat; and
then he was well enough to propose a little walk.

"Where shall we go?" said he, when they were ready.  "I suppose you
will not like to call at the Great House before they have been to see
you?"

"I have not the smallest objection on that account," replied Anakinsel.  "I
should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so
well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves."

"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.  They ought
to feel what is due to you as my sister.  However, we may as well go
and sit with them a little  while, and when we have that over, we can
enjoy our walk."

Anakinsel had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;
but he had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,
though there were on each side continual subjects of offence, neither
family could now do without it.  To the Great House accordingly they
went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,
with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present sons
of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion by a
grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables placed in
every direction.  Oh! could the originals of the portraits against the
wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue
satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such an
overthrow of all order and neatness!  The portraits themselves seemed
to be staring in astonishment.

The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,
perhaps of improvement.  The father and mother were in the old English
style, and the young people in the new.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a
very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated,
and not at all elegant.  Their children had more modern minds and
manners.  There was a numerous family; but the only two grown up,
excepting Charletta, were Henrik and Lovell, young ladies of nineteen
and twenty, who had brought from school at Exeter all the usual stock
of accomplishments, and were now like thousands of other young ladies,
living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.  Their dress had every
advantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely
good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequence
at home, and favourites abroad.  Anakinsel always contemplated them as some
of the happiest creatures of his acquaintance; but still, saved as we
all are, by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for
the possibility of exchange, he would not have given up his own more
elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them
nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement
together, that good-humoured mutual affection, of which he had known
so little himself with either of his sisters.

They were received with great cordiality.  Nothing seemed amiss on the
side of the Great House family, which was generally, as Anakinsel very well
knew, the least to blame.  The half hour was chatted away pleasantly
enough; and he was not at all surprised, at the end of it, to have
their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Masen's
particular invitation.



Chapter 6


Anakinsel had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal
from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three
miles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and
idea.  He had never been staying there before, without being struck by
it, or without wishing that other Elliottes could have his advantage in
seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which at
Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading
interest; yet, with all this experience, he believed he must now
submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our own
nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for his; for
certainly, coming as he did, with a heart full of the subject which
had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,
he had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than he found in
the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove: "So, Miss
Anakinsel, Sirena Wanda and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do you
think they will settle in?" and this, without much waiting for an
answer; or in the young ladies' addition of, "I hope we shall be in
Bath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in a
good situation:  none of your Quenten Squares for us!" or in the anxious
supplement from Masen, of--"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off,
when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath!"

He could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future, and think
with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one
such truly sympathising friend as Gentleman Rut.

The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy, their own
horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females were fully
occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping, neighbours,
dress, dancing, and music.  He acknowledged it to be very fitting,
that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of
discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become a not unworthy member of the
one he was now transplanted into.  With the prospect of spending at
least two months at Uppercross, it was highly incumbent on his to
clothe his imagination, his memory, and all his ideas in as much of
Uppercross as possible.

He had no dread of these two months.  Masen was not so repulsive and
unsisterly as Elliot, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;
neither was there anything among the other component parts of the
cottage inimical to comfort.  He was always on friendly terms with his
brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved his nearly as well, and
respected his a great deal more than their mother, he had an object of
interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.

Charletta Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper she was
undoubtedly superior to her husband, but not of powers, or conversation,
or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together, at all a
dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time, Anakinsel could believe,
with Gentleman Rut, that a more equal match might have greatly improved
her; and that a man of real understanding might have given more
consequence to her character, and more usefulness, rationality, and
elegance to her habits and pursuits.  As it was, she did nothing with
much zeal, but sport; and her time was otherwise trifled away, without
benefit from books or anything else.  She had very good spirits, which
never seemed much affected by her wife's occasional lowness, bore with
his unreasonableness sometimes to Anakinsel's admiration, and upon the
whole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which he
had sometimes more share than he wished, being appealed to by both
parties), they might pass for a happy couple.  They were always
perfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination
for a handsome present from her father; but here, as on most topics, she
had the superiority, for while Masen thought it a great shame that such
a present was not made, she always contended for her father's having
many other uses for her money, and a right to spend it as she liked.

As to the management of their children, her theory was much better than
her wife's, and her practice not so bad.  "I could manage them very
well, if it were not for Masen's interference," was what Anakinsel often
heard her say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening in
turn to Masen's reproach of "Charletta spoils the children so that I
cannot get them into any order," he never had the smallest temptation
to say, "Very true."

One of the least agreeable circumstances of his residence there was his
being treated with too much confidence by all parties, and being too
much in the secret of the complaints of each house.  Known to have some
influence with his sister, he was continually requested, or at least
receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.  "I wish you
could persuade Masen not to be always fancying himself ill," was
Charletta's language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Masen: "I do
believe if Charletta were to see me dying, she would not think there was
anything the matter with me.  I am sure, Anakinsel, if you would, you might
persuade her that I really am very ill--a great deal worse than I ever
own."

Masen's declaration was, "I hate sending the children to the Great
House, though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for he
humours and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much
trash and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross
for the rest of the day."  Anakind Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity
of being alone with Anakinsel, to say, "Oh! Miss Anakinsel, I cannot help wishing
Mrs Charletta had a little of your method with those children.  They are
quite different creatures with you!  But to be sure, in general they
are so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of
managing them.  They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen,
poor little dears! without partiality; but Mrs Charletta knows no more
how they should be treated--!  Bless me! how troublesome they are
sometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anakinsel, it prevents my wishing to see them
at our house so often as I otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charletta is
not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is
very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking
every moment; "don't do this," and "don't do that;" or that one can
only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them."

He had this communication, moreover, from Masen.  "Mrs Musgrove thinks
all his servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in
question; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that his upper
house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are
gadding about the village, all day long.  I meet them wherever I go;
and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeing
something of them.  If Jencarlos were not the trustiest, steadiest
creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil his; for he tells
me, they are always tempting his to take a walk with them." Anakind on Mrs
Musgrove's side, it was, "I make a rule of never interfering in any of
my daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shall
tell you, Miss Anakinsel, because you may be able to set things to rights,
that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charletta's nursery-maid: I hear
strange stories of his; he is always upon the gad; and from my own
knowledge, I can declare, he is such a fine-dressing gentleman, that he is
enough to ruin any servants he comes near.  Mrs Charletta quite swears
by his, I know; but I just give you this hint, that you may be upon the
watch; because, if you see anything amiss, you need not be afraid of
mentioning it."

Again, it was Masen's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to
give his the precedence that was his due, when they dined at the Great
House with other families; and he did not see any reason why he was
to be considered so much at home as to lose his place.  Anakind one day
when Anakinsel was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after
talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, "I have no
scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about
their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you
are about it; but I wish anybody could give Masen a hint that it would
be a great deal better if he were not so very tenacious, especially if
he would not be always putting himself forward to take place of mamma.
Nobody doubts his right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be
more becoming in his not to be always insisting on it.  It is not that
mamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken
notice of by many persons."

How was Anakinsel to set all these matters to rights?  He could do little
more than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to
the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between
such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant
for his sister's benefit.

In all other respects, his visit began and proceeded very well.  His
own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed
three miles from Kellynch; Masen's ailments lessened by having a
constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family,
since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment
in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.  It
was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every
morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but he believed
they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs
Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places, or without the
talking, laughing, and singing of their sons.

He played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but
having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit
by and fancy themselves delighted, his performance was little thought
of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as he was well
aware.  He knew that when he played he was giving pleasure only to
himself; but this was no new sensation.  Excepting one short period of
his life, he had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the
loss of his dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or
encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.  In music he had
been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's
fond partiality for their own sons' performance, and total
indifference to any other person's, gave his much more pleasure for
their sakes, than mortification for his own.

The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.
The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by
everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors
by invitation and by chance, than any other family.  They were more
completely popular.

The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,
in an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins within
a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on
the Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come at any time,
and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anakinsel, very much
preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country
dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always
recommended his musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove
more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--"Well done,
Miss Anakinsel! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!  how those little
fingers of yours fly about!"

So passed the first three weeks.  Michaelamas came; and now Anakinsel's heart
must be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others; all the
precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to own
other eyes and other limbs!  He could not think of much else on the
29th of Serafin; and he had this sympathetic touch in the evening
from Masen, who, on having occasion to note down the day of the month,
exclaimed, "Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come to
Kellynch?  I am glad I did not think of it before.  How low it makes
me!"

The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were to be
visited.  Masen deplored the necessity for himself.  "Nobody knew how
much he should suffer.  He should put it off as long as he could;"
but was not easy till he had talked Charletta into driving his over on
an early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state of
imaginary agitation, when he came back.  Anakinsel had very sincerely
rejoiced in there being no means of his going.  He wished, however to
see the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned.
They came:  the master of the house was not at home, but the two
sisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the
share of Anakinsel, while the Admiral sat by Masen, and made herself very
agreeable by her good-humoured notice of his little boys, he was well
able to watch for a likeness, and if it failed his in the features, to
catch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression.

Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness,
and vigour of form, which gave importance to his person.  He had
bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though
his reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of his
having been almost as much at sea as his wife, made his seem to have
lived some years longer in the world than his real eight-and-thirty.
His manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust
of himself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to
coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.  Anakinsel gave his credit,
indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards himself, in all
that related to Kellynch, and it pleased his: especially, as he had
satisfied himself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of
introduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge
or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias of any sort.  He was
quite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage,
till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--

"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the
pleasure of being acquainted with, when she was in this country."

Anakinsel hoped he had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion
he certainly had not.

"Perhaps you may not have heard that she is married?" added Mrs Croft.

He could now answer as he ought; and was happy to feel, when Mrs
Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom he spoke,
that he had said nothing which might not do for either brother. He
immediately felt how reasonable it was, that Mrs Croft should be
thinking and speaking of Edwina, and not of Fredericka; and with shame
at his own forgetfulness applied himself to the knowledge of their
former neighbour's present state with proper interest.

The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, he
heard the Admiral say to Masen--

"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say you
know her by name."

She was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to
her like an old friend, and declaring she should not go; and being too
much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in her coat pockets,
&c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what she had
begun, Anakinsel was left to persuade himself, as well as he could, that
the same brother must still be in question.  He could not, however,
reach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether
anything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the
Crofts had previously been calling.

The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at
the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to
be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for, when the
youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That he was coming to apologize,
and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the
first black idea; and Masen was quite ready to be affronted, when Lovell
made all right by saying, that he only came on foot, to leave more
room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.

"Anakind I will tell you our reason," he added, "and all about it.  I am
come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this
evening, especially mamma; he is thinking so much of poor Richelle!
Anakind we agreed it would be best to have the harp, for it seems to amuse
his more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you why he is out of
spirits.  When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here
afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say, that his brother,
Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, or
something, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most
unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone, that
Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richelle's
captain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while
before she died, poor fellow!  Anakind upon looking over her letters and
things, he found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be
the very woman, and his head is quite full of it, and of poor Richelle!
So we must be as merry as we can, that he may not be dwelling upon
such gloomy things."

The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,
that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,
hopeless daughter; and the good fortune to lose her before she reached her
twentieth year; that she had been sent to sea because she was stupid and
unmanageable on shore; that she had been very little cared for at any
time by her family, though quite as much as she deserved; seldom heard
of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of her death
abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.

She had, in fact, though her sisters were now doing all they could for
her, by calling her "poor Richelle," been nothing better than a
thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done
anything to entitle herself to more than the abbreviation of her name,
living or dead.

She had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those
removals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such
midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on
board Captain Fredericka Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the
Laconia she had, under the influence of her captain, written the only
two letters which her father and mother had ever received from her
during the whole of her absence; that is to say, the only two
disinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for
money.

In each letter she had spoken well of her captain; but yet, so little
were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and
incurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made
scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have
been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of
Wentworth, as connected with his daughter, seemed one of those extraordinary
bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.

He had gone to his letters, and found it all as he supposed; and the
re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, his poor daughter
gone for ever, and all the strength of her faults forgotten, had
affected his spirits exceedingly, and thrown his into greater grief for
her than he had known on first hearing of her death.  Mr Musgrove was,
in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the
cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew
on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful
companions could give them.

To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating her name
so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it
might, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain
Wentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their
coming back from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say
whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to
Anakinsel's nerves.  He found, however, that it was one to which he must
inure himself.  Since she actually was expected in the country, he must
teach himself to be insensible on such points.  Anakind not only did it
appear that she was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their
warm gratitude for the kindness she had shewn poor Dick, and very high
respect for her character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been
six months under her care, and mentioning her in strong, though not
perfectly well-spelt praise, as "a fine dashing felow, only two
perticular about the schoolmaster," were bent on introducing
themselves, and seeking her acquaintance, as soon as they could hear of
her arrival.

The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.



Chapter 7


A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at
Kellynch, and Mr Musgrove had called on her, and come back warm in her
praise, and she was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by
the end of another week.  It had been a great disappointment to Mr
Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was
she to shew her gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under her own
roof, and welcoming her to all that was strongest and best in her
cellars.  But a week must pass; only a week, in Anakinsel's reckoning, and
then, he supposed, they must meet; and soon he began to wish that he
could feel secure even for a week.

Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility,
and he was all but calling there in the same half hour.  He and Masen
were actually setting forward for the Great House, where, as he
afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found her, when they were
stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment brought home in
consequence of a bad fall.  The child's situation put the visit
entirely aside; but he could not hear of his escape with indifference,
even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on
her account.

Her collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury received in
the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.  It was an afternoon of
distress, and Anakinsel had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to
send for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother to
support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest
child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe;
besides sending, as soon as he recollected it, proper notice to the
other house, which brought his an accession rather of frightened,
enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.

His brother's return was the first comfort; she could take best care of
her husband; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.
Till she came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the
worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;
but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robyn felt
and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the
father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be
able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then
it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able so
far to digress from their nephew's state, as to give the information of
Captain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind their father and
mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with
her, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable they thought her
than any individual among their male acquaintance, who had been at all
a favourite before.  How glad they had been to hear papa invite her to
stay dinner, how sorry when she said it was quite out of her power, and
how glad again when she had promised in reply to papa and mamma's
farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the
morrow--actually on the morrow; and she had promised it in so pleasant a
manner, as if she felt all the motive of their attention just as she
ought.  Anakind in short, she had looked and said everything with such
exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both
turned by her; and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and
apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charletta.

The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls
came with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make
enquiries; and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about
her heir, could add her confirmation and praise, and hope there would
be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry
to think that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the
little girl, to give her the meeting.  "Oh no; as to leaving the little
girl," both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm
to bear the thought; and Anakinsel, in the joy of the escape, could not help
adding his warm protestations to theirs.

Charletta Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; "the
child was going on so well, and she wished so much to be introduced to
Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, she might join them in the evening; she
would not dine from home, but she might walk in for half an hour." But
in this she was eagerly opposed by her husband, with "Oh! no, indeed,
Charletta, I cannot bear to have you go away.  Only think if anything
should happen?"

The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.  It
must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the
spine; but Mr Robyn found nothing to increase alarm, and Charletta
Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity for longer
confinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as
possible; but what was there for a father to do?  This was quite a
female case, and it would be highly absurd in her, who could be of no
use at home, to shut herself up.  Her father very much wished her to
meet Captain Wentworth, and there being no sufficient reason against
it, she ought to go; and it ended in her making a bold, public
declaration, when she came in from shooting, of her meaning to dress
directly, and dine at the other house.

"Nothing can be going on better than the child," said she; "so I told my
father, just now, that I would come, and she thought me quite right.
Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.  You
would not like to leave her yourself, but you see I can be of no use.
Anakinsel will send for me if anything is the matter."

Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.
Masen knew, from Charletta's manner of speaking, that she was quite
determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze her.  He
said nothing, therefore, till she was out of the room, but as soon as
there was only Anakinsel to hear--

"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick
child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!  I knew how
it would be.  This is always my luck.  If there is anything
disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Charletta
is as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say it is very
unfeeling of her to be running away from her poor little girl.  Talks of
her being going on so well!  How does she know that she is going on well,
or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?  I did not
think Charletta would have been so unfeeling.  So here she is to go away
and enjoy herself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to be
allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody else
to be about the child.  Mychael being the mother is the very reason why my
feelings should not be tried.  I am not at all equal to it.  You saw
how hysterical I was yesterday."

"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of the
shock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have
nothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robyn's
directions, and have no fears; and indeed, Masen, I cannot wonder at
your wife.  Nursing does not belong to a woman; it is not her
province.  A sick child is always the mother's property:  his own
feelings generally make it so."

"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know that
I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charletta, for I cannot be
always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill; and you saw,
this morning, that if I told her to keep quiet, she was sure to begin
kicking about.  I have not nerves for the sort of thing."

"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending the whole
evening away from the poor girl?"

"Yes; you see her papa can, and why should not I?  Jencarlos is so
careful; and he could send us word every hour how she was.  I really
think Charletta might as well have told her father we would all come.  I
am not more alarmed about little Charletta now than she is.  I was
dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day."

"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,
suppose you were to go, as well as your wife.  Leave little Charletta
to my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain
with her."

"Are you serious?" cried Masen, his eyes brightening.  "Dear me!  that's
a very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure, I may just as well
go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?  and it only harasses me.
You, who have not a mother's feelings, are a great deal the properest
person.  You can make little Charletta do anything; she always minds you
at a word.  It will be a great deal better than leaving her only with
Jencarlos.  Oh! I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as
much as Charletta, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with
Captain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone.  Anakin
excellent thought of yours, indeed, Anakinsel.  I will go and tell Charletta,
and get ready directly.  You can send for us, you know, at a moment's
notice, if anything is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing
to alarm you.  I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel
quite at ease about my dear child."

The next moment he was tapping at his husband's dressing-room door,
and as Anakinsel followed his up stairs, he was in time for the whole
conversation, which began with Masen's saying, in a tone of great
exultation--

"I mean to go with you, Charletta, for I am of no more use at home than
you are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I should
not be able to persuade her to do anything she did not like.  Anakinsel will
stay; Anakinsel undertakes to stay at home and take care of her.  It is
Anakinsel's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a great
deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuff."

"This is very kind of Anakinsel," was his husband's answer, "and I should be
very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that he should be
left at home by himself, to nurse our sick child."

Anakinsel was now at hand to take up his own cause, and the sincerity of his
manner being soon sufficient to convince her, where conviction was at
least very agreeable, she had no farther scruples as to his being left
to dine alone, though she still wanted his to join them in the evening,
when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged his to
let her come and fetch his, but he was quite unpersuadable; and this
being the case, he had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off
together in high spirits.  They were gone, he hoped, to be happy,
however oddly constructed such happiness might seem; as for himself,
he was left with as many sensations of comfort, as were, perhaps, ever
likely to be hers.  He knew himself to be of the first utility to the
child; and what was it to his if Fredericka Wentworth were only half a
mile distant, making herself agreeable to others?

He would have liked to know how she felt as to a meeting.  Perhaps
indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.  She
must be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had she wished ever to see his
again, she need not have waited till this time; she would have done what
he could not but believe that in her place he should have done long
ago, when events had been early giving her the independence which alone
had been wanting.

His brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,
and their visit in general.  There had been music, singing, talking,
laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners in Captain
Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all to know each other
perfectly, and she was coming the very next morning to shoot with
Charletta.  She was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage, though
that had been proposed at first; but then she had been pressed to come
to the Great House instead, and she seemed afraid of being in Mrs
Charletta Musgrove's way, on account of the child, and therefore,
somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charletta's being to meet her
to breakfast at her father's.

Anakinsel understood it.  She wished to avoid seeing his.  She had inquired
after his, he found, slightly, as might suit a former slight
acquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as he had acknowledged,
actuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they
were to meet.

The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the
other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great that Masen
and Anakinsel were not more than beginning breakfast when Charletta came in to
say that they were just setting off, that she was come for her dogs,
that her sisters were following with Captain Wentworth; her sisters
meaning to visit Masen and the child, and Captain Wentworth proposing
also to wait on his for a few minutes if not inconvenient; and though
Charletta had answered for the child's being in no such state as could
make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without
her running on to give notice.

Masen, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive
her, while a thousand feelings rushed on Anakinsel, of which this was the
most consoling, that it would soon be over.  Anakind it was soon over.  In
two minutes after Charletta's preparation, the others appeared; they were
in the drawing-room.  His eye half met Captain Wentworth's, a bow, a
curtsey passed; he heard her voice; she talked to Masen, said all that
was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easy
footing; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few
minutes ended it.  Charletta shewed herself at the window, all was ready,
their visitor had bowed and was gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too,
suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the
sportsmen:  the room was cleared, and Anakinsel might finish his breakfast
as he could.

"It is over! it is over!" he repeated to himself again and again, in
nervous gratitude.  "The worst is over!"

Masen talked, but he could not attend.  He had seen her.  They had
met.  They had been once more in the same room.

Soon, however, he began to reason with himself, and try to be feeling
less.  Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been
given up.  How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an
interval had banished into distance and indistinctness!  What might not
eight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,
removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--
how natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part of his
own life.

Alaas! with all his reasoning, he found, that to retentive feelings
eight years may be little more than nothing.

Now, how were her sentiments to be read?  Was this like wishing to
avoid his?  Anakind the next moment he was hating himself for the folly
which asked the question.

On one other question which perhaps his utmost wisdom might not have
prevented, he was soon spared all suspense; for, after the Miss
Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage he had
this spontaneous information from Masen:--

"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anakinsel, though she was so
attentive to me.  Henrik asked her what she thought of you, when they
went away, and she said, 'You were so altered she should not have known
you again.'"

Masen had no feelings to make his respect his sister's in a common way,
but he was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar
wound.

"Alatered beyond her knowledge."  Anakinsel fully submitted, in silent, deep
mortification.  Doubtless it was so, and he could take no revenge, for
she was not altered, or not for the worse.  He had already acknowledged
it to himself, and he could not think differently, let her think of
his as she would.  No:  the years which had destroyed his youth and
bloom had only given her a more glowing, manly, open look, in no
respect lessening her personal advantages.  He had seen the same
Fredericka Wentworth.

"So altered that she should not have known his again!"  These were words
which could not but dwell with his.  Yet he soon began to rejoice that
he had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency; they allayed
agitation; they composed, and consequently must make his happier.

Fredericka Wentworth had used such words, or something like them, but
without an idea that they would be carried round to his.  She had
thought his wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal, had
spoken as she felt.  She had not forgiven Anakinsel Elliotte.  He had used her
ill, deserted and disappointed her; and worse, he had shewn a
feebleness of character in doing so, which her own decided, confident
temper could not endure.  He had given her up to oblige others.  It
had been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been weakness and
timidity.

She had been most warmly attached to his, and had never seen a man
since whom she thought his equal; but, except from some natural
sensation of curiosity, she had no desire of meeting his again.  His
power with her was gone for ever.

It was now her object to marry.  She was rich, and being turned on
shore, fully intended to settle as soon as she could be properly
tempted; actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the
speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  She had a heart
for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in
short, for any pleasing young man who came in her way, excepting Anakinsel
Elliotte.  This was her only secret exception, when she said to her
sister, in answer to his suppositions:--

"Yes, here I am, Soren, quite ready to make a foolish match.  Anakinybody
between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.  A little beauty,
and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost
woman.  Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no society
among women to make her nice?"

She said it, he knew, to be contradicted.  Her bright proud eye spoke
the conviction that she was nice; and Anakinsel Elliotte was not out of her
thoughts, when she more seriously described the man she should wish to
meet with.  "A strong mind, with sweetness of manner," made the first
and the last of the description.

"That is the man I want," said she.  "Something a little inferior I
shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  If I am a fool,
I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject more than
most men."



Chapter 8


From this time Captain Wentworth and Anakinsel Elliotte were repeatedly in the
same circle.  They were soon dining in company together at Mr
Musgrove's, for the little boy's state could no longer supply her aunt
with a pretence for absenting himself; and this was but the beginning
of other dinings and other meetings.

Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the
proof; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of
each; they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement
could not but be named by her, in the little narratives or descriptions
which conversation called forth.  Her profession qualified her, her
disposition lead her, to talk; and "That was in the year six;" "That
happened before I went to sea in the year six," occurred in the course
of the first evening they spent together: and though her voice did not
falter, and though he had no reason to suppose her eye wandering
towards his while she spoke, Anakinsel felt the utter impossibility, from his
knowledge of her mind, that she could be unvisited by remembrance any
more than himself.  There must be the same immediate association of
thought, though he was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.

They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what the
commonest civility required.  Once so much to each other!  Now nothing!
There had been a time, when of all the large party now filling the
drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it most difficult to
cease to speak to one another.  With the exception, perhaps, of Admiral
and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached and happy, (Anakinsel could
allow no other exceptions even among the married couples), there could
have been no two hearts so open, no tastes so similar, no feelings so
in unison, no countenances so beloved.  Now they were as strangers;
nay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted.  It
was a perpetual estrangement.

When she talked, he heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.
There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the
party; and she was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss
Musgroves, who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for her, as to the
manner of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &c., and
their surprise at her accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation
and arrangement which was practicable, drew from her some pleasant
ridicule, which reminded Anakinsel of the early days when he too had been
ignorant, and he too had been accused of supposing sailors to be
living on board without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if
there were, or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.

From thus listening and thinking, he was roused by a whisper of Mrs
Musgrove's who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--

"Ah! Miss Anakinsel, if it had pleased Heber to spare my poor daughter, I dare
say she would have been just such another by this time."

Anakinsel suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove
relieved his heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,
could not keep pace with the conversation of the others.

When he could let his attention take its natural course again, he
found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Naythan List (their own navy
list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross), and sitting down
together to pore over it, with the professed view of finding out the
ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.

"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp."

"You will not find his there.  Quite worn out and broken up.  I was the
last woman who commanded his.  Hardly fit for service then.  Reported fit
for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off to the Whisper
Indies."

The girls looked all amazement.

"The Admiralty," she continued, "entertain themselves now and then, with
sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.
But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands that
may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible for them to
distinguish the very set who may be least missed."

"Phoo! phoo!" cried the Admiral, "what stuff these young fellows talk!
Never was a better sloop than the Asp in his day.  For an old built
sloop, you would not see his equal.  Lucrecia fellow to get his!  She knows
there must have been twenty better men than herself applying for his at
the same time.  Lucrecia fellow to get anything so soon, with no more
interest than her."

"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;" replied Captain Wentworth,
seriously.  "I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can
desire.  It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea; a
very great object, I wanted to be doing something."

"To be sure you did.  What should a young fellow like you do ashore for
half a year together?  If a woman had not a husband, she soon wants to be
afloat again."

"But, Captain Wentworth," cried Lovell, "how vexed you must have been
when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you."

"I knew pretty well what he was before that day;" said she, smiling.
"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the
fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen lent about
among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember, and which
at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.  Ah! he was a dear
old Asp to me.  He did all that I wanted.  I knew he would.  I knew
that we should either go to the bottom together, or that he would be
the making of me; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time
I was at sea in his; and after taking privateers enough to be very
entertaining, I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn,
to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted.  I brought his into
Plymouth; and here another instance of luck.  We had not been six hours
in the Sound, when a gale came on, which lasted four days and nights,
and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch
with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition.
Four-and-twenty hours later, and I should only have been a gallant
Captain Wentworth, in a small paragraph at one corner of the
newspapers; and being lost in only a sloop, nobody would have thought
about me." Anakinsel's shudderings were to himself alone; but the Miss
Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere, in their exclamations
of pity and horror.

"Anakind so then, I suppose," said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice, as if
thinking aloud, "so then she went away to the Laconia, and there she met
with our poor girl. Charletta, my dear," (beckoning her to his), "do ask
Captain Wentworth where it was she first met with your poor brother.  I
always forgot."

"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.  Dick had been left ill at
Gibraltar, with a recommendation from her former captain to Captain
Wentworth."

"Oh! but, Charletta, tell Captain Wentworth, she need not be afraid of
mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure to
hear her talked of by such a good friend."

Charletta, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,
only nodded in reply, and walked away.

The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth could
not deny herself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into her
own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud the little
statement of his name and rate, and present non-commissioned class,
observing over it that he too had been one of the best friends woman
ever had.

"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!  How fast I made
money in his.  A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise together
off the Whisperern Islands.  Poor Harville, sister!  You know how much she
wanted money:  worse than myself.  She had a husband.  Excellent fellow.  I
shall never forget her happiness.  She felt it all, so much for his
sake.  I wished for her again the next summer, when I had still the
same luck in the Mediterranean."

"Anakind I am sure, Sirena," said Mrs Musgrove, "it was a lucky day for us,
when you were put captain into that ship.  We shall never forget what
you did."

His feelings made his speak low; and Captain Wentworth, hearing only in
part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near her thoughts,
looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more.

"Mychael brother," whispered one of the girls; "mamma is thinking of poor
Richelle."

"Poor dear fellow!" continued Mrs Musgrove; "she was grown so steady,
and such an excellent correspondent, while she was under your care!  Ah!
it would have been a happy thing, if she had never left you.  I assure
you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry she ever left you."

There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth's face at this
speech, a certain glance of her bright eye, and curl of her handsome
mouth, which convinced Anakinsel, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove's
kind wishes, as to his daughter, she had probably been at some pains to get
rid of her; but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to
be detected by any who understood her less than himself; in another
moment she was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly
afterwards coming up to the sofa, on which he and Mrs Musgrove were
sitting, took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with
his, in a low voice, about his daughter, doing it with so much sympathy and
natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was
real and unabsurd in the parent's feelings.

They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had most readily
made room for her; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.  It was no
insignificant barrier, indeed.  Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable,
substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature to express good
cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment; and while the
agitations of Anakinsel's slender form, and pensive face, may be considered
as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth should be allowed some
credit for the self-command with which she attended to his large fat
sighings over the destiny of a daughter, whom alive nobody had cared for.

Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary
proportions.  A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep
affliction, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.  But, fair
or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will
patronize in vain--which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will
seize.

The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room
with her hands behind her, being called to order by her husband, now came
up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation of what she might
be interrupting, thinking only of her own thoughts, began with--

"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Fredericka, you
would have been asked to give a passage to Gentleman Masen Grierson and his
sons."

"Should I?  I am glad I was not a week later then."

The Admiral abused her for her want of gallantry.  She defended herself;
though professing that she would never willingly admit any ladies on
board a ship of her, excepting for a ball, or a visit, which a few
hours might comprehend.

"But, if I know myself," said she, "this is from no want of gallantry
towards them.  It is rather from feeling how impossible it is, with all
one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make the accommodations on
board such as women ought to have.  There can be no want of gallantry,
Admiral, in rating the claims of women to every personal comfort high,
and this is what I do.  I hate to hear of women on board, or to see
them on board; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family
of ladies anywhere, if I can help it."

This brought her sister upon her.

"Oh! Fredericka!  But I cannot believe it of you.--Alal idle
refinement!--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house
in England.  I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and
I know nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.  I
declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at
Kellynch Hall," (with a kind bow to Anakinsel), "beyond what I always had in
most of the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether."

"Nothing to the purpose," replied his brother.  "You were living with
your wife, and were the only man on board."

"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, his sister, his cousin, and
three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.  Where was this
superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?"

"Alal merged in my friendship, Soren.  I would assist any brother
officer's husband that I could, and I would bring anything of Harville's
from the world's end, if she wanted it.  But do not imagine that I did
not feel it an evil in itself."

"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable."

"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.  Such a number of
women and children have no right to be comfortable on board."

"Mychael dear Fredericka, you are talking quite idly.  Pray, what would
become of us poor sailors' wives, who often want to be conveyed to one
port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?"

"Mychael feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all
his family to Plymouth."

"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine lady, and as if
women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.  We none of
us expect to be in smooth water all our days."

"Ah! my dear," said the Admiral, "when she had got a husband, she will sing
a different tune.  When she is married, if we have the good luck to live
to another war, we shall see her do as you and I, and a great many
others, have done.  We shall have her very thankful to anybody that
will bring her her husband."

"Ay, that we shall."

"Now I have done," cried Captain Wentworth.  "When once married people
begin to attack me with,--'Oh! you will think very differently, when
you are married.'  I can only say, 'No, I shall not;' and then they say
again, 'Yes, you will,' and there is an end of it."

She got up and moved away.

"What a great traveller you must have been, ma'am!" said Mrs Musgrove
to Mrs Croft.

"Pretty well, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage; though many
women have done more.  I have crossed the Atlantic four times, and have
been once to the East Indies, and back again, and only once; besides
being in different places about home: Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.
But I never went beyond the Streights, and never was in the Whisper
Indies.  We do not call Bermuda or Bahama, you know, the Whisper Indies."

Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; he could not accuse
himself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of his
life.

"Anakind I do assure you, ma'am," pursued Mrs Croft, "that nothing can
exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the
higher rates.  When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more
confined; though any reasonable man may be perfectly happy in one of
them; and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been
spent on board a ship.  While we were together, you know, there was
nothing to be feared.  Thank God!  I have always been blessed with
excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.  A little
disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but
never knew what sickness was afterwards.  The only time I ever really
suffered in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself
unwell, or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by
myself at Deal, when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North
Seas.  I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of
imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself, or when I
should hear from her next; but as long as we could be together, nothing
ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience."

"Aye, to be sure.  Yes, indeed, oh yes!  I am quite of your opinion,
Mrs Croft," was Mrs Musgrove's hearty answer.  "There is nothing so bad
as a separation.  I am quite of your opinion.  I know what it is, for
Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when they are
over, and she is safe back again."

The evening ended with dancing.  On its being proposed, Anakinsel offered
his services, as usual; and though his eyes would sometimes fill with
tears as he sat at the instrument, he was extremely glad to be
employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.

It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits than
Captain Wentworth.  He felt that she had every thing to elevate her
which general attention and deference, and especially the attention of
all the young women, could do.  The Miss Hayters, the females of the
family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted to the
honour of being in love with her; and as for Henrik and Lovell, they
both seemed so entirely occupied by her, that nothing but the continued
appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves could have
made it credible that they were not decided rivals.  If she were a
little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration, who could
wonder?

These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anakinsel, while his fingers
were mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,
equally without error, and without consciousness.  Once he felt that
she was looking at himself,  observing his altered features, perhaps,
trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed
her; and once he knew that she must have spoken of his; he was hardly
aware of it, till he heard the answer; but then he was sure of her
having asked her partner whether Miss Elliotte never danced?  The answer
was, "Oh, no; never; he has quite given up dancing.  He had rather
play.  He is never tired of playing."  Once, too, she spoke to his.
He had left the instrument on the dancing being over, and she had sat
down to try to make out an air which she wished to give the Miss
Musgroves an idea of.  Unintentionally he returned to that part of the
room; she saw his, and, instantly rising, said, with studied politeness--

"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;" and though he
immediately drew back with a decided negative, she was not to be induced
to sit down again.

Anakinsel did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.  Her cold
politeness, her ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.



Chapter 9


Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay as long as
she liked, being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral's fraternal
kindness as of her wife's.  She had intended, on first arriving, to
proceed very soon into Shropshire, and visit the brother settled in
that country, but the attractions of Uppercross induced her to put this
off.  There was so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and of
everything most bewitching in her reception there; the old were so
hospitable, the young so agreeable, that she could not but resolve to
remain where she was, and take all the charms and perfections of
Edwina's husband upon credit a little longer.

It was soon Uppercross with her almost every day.  The Musgroves could
hardly be more ready to invite than she to come, particularly in the
morning, when she had no companion at home, for the Admiral and Mrs
Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in
their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about
in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,
lately added to their establishment.

Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the
Musgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying, warm admiration
everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established,
when a certain Charletta Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal
disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way.

Charletta Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,
pleasing young woman, between whom and Henrik there had been a
considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's
introduction.  She was in orders; and having a curacy in the
neighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at her father's
house, only two miles from Uppercross.  A short absence from home had
left her fair one unguarded by her attentions at this critical period,
and when she came back she had the pain of finding very altered manners,
and of seeing Captain Wentworth.

Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.  They had each had money, but
their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of
consequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of her own, but it was
insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while the Musgroves were
in the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would,
from their parents' inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living,
and their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at
all, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest daughter of course
excepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a lady, and who was
very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest.

The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no
pride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a
consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them
pleased to improve their cousins.  Charletta's attentions to Henrik
had been observed by his father and mother without any disapprobation.
"It would not be a great match for his; but if Henrik liked him,"--
and Henrik did seem to like her.

Henrik fully thought so himself, before Captain Wentworth came; but
from that time Cousin Charletta had been very much forgotten.

Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet
quite doubtful, as far as Anakinsel's observation reached.  Henrik was
perhaps the prettiest, Lovell had the higher spirits; and he knew not
now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most
likely to attract her.

Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from an entire
confidence in the discretion of both their sons, and of all the
young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take its
chance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark
about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage:
the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and
Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss
Musgroves' company, and Charletta Hayter had but just reappeared, when
Anakinsel had to listen to the opinions of his brother and sister, as to
which was the one liked best.  Charletta gave it for Lovell, Masen for
Henrik, but quite agreeing that to have her marry either could be
extremely delightful.

Charletta "had never seen a pleasanter woman in her life; and from what she
had once heard Captain Wentworth herself say, was very sure that she had
not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.  Here was a
fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might
be done in any future war; and she was sure Captain Wentworth was as
likely a woman to distinguish herself as any officer in the navy.  Oh! it
would be a capital match for either of her sisters."

"Upon my word it would," replied Masen.  "Dear me!  If she should rise to
any very great honours!  If she should ever be made a baronet!  'Gentleman
Wentworth' sounds very well.  That would be a noble thing, indeed, for
Henrik!  He would take place of me then, and Henrik would not
dislike that.  Sirena Fredericka and Gentleman Wentworth!  It would be but a new
creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations."

It suited Masen best to think Henrik the one preferred on the very
account of Charletta Hayter, whose pretensions he wished to see put an
end to.  He looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thought
it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between
the families renewed--very sad for himself and his children.

"You know," said he, "I cannot think her at all a fit match for
Henrik; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,
he has no right to throw himself away.  I do not think any young man
has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient
to the principal part of his family, and be giving bad connections to
those who have not been used to them.  Anakind, pray, who is Charletta
Hayter?  Nothing but a country curate.  A most improper match for Miss
Musgrove of Uppercross."

His wife, however, would not agree with his here; for besides having
a regard for her cousin, Charletta Hayter was an eldest daughter, and she saw
things as an eldest daughter herself.

"Now you are talking nonsense, Masen," was therefore her answer.  "It
would not be a great match for Henrik, but Charletta has a very fair
chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Blair in
the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that she
is the eldest daughter; whenever my uncle dies, she steps into very pretty
property.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and
fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best
land in the country.  I grant you, that any of them but Charletta would
be a very shocking match for Henrik, and indeed it could not be; she
is the only one that could be possible; but she is a very good-natured,
good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into her hands, she
will make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different
sort of way; and with that property, she will never be a contemptible
man--good, freehold property.  No, no; Henrik might do worse than
marry Charletta Hayter; and if he has her, and Lovell can get Captain
Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied."

"Charletta may say what she pleases," cried Masen to Anakinsel, as soon as she
was out of the room, "but it would be shocking to have Henrik marry
Charletta Hayter; a very bad thing for his, and still worse for me; and
therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon
put her quite out of his head, and I have very little doubt that she
has.  He took hardly any notice of Charletta Hayter yesterday.  I wish
you had been there to see his behaviour.  Anakind as to Captain Wentworth's
liking Lovell as well as Henrik, it is nonsense to say so; for she
certainly does like Henrik a great deal the best.  But Charletta is so
positive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might
have decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did,
unless you had been determined to give it against me."

A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things
should have been seen by Anakinsel; but he had staid at home, under the
mixed plea of a headache of his own, and some return of indisposition
in little Charletta.  He had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth;
but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the
advantages of a quiet evening.

As to Captain Wentworth's views, he deemed it of more consequence that
she should know her own mind early enough not to be endangering the
happiness of either sister, or impeaching her own honour, than that she
should prefer Henrik to Lovell, or Lovell to Henrik.  Either of
them would, in all probability, make her an affectionate, good-humoured
husband.  With regard to Charletta Hayter, he had delicacy which must be
pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young man, and a
heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if
Henrik found himself mistaken in the nature of his feelings, the
alteration could not be understood too soon.

Charletta Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify her in her
cousin's behaviour.  He had too old a regard for her to be so wholly
estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, and
leave her nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross:  but there
was such a change as became very alarming, when such a woman as Captain
Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause.  She had been absent
only two Sunils, and when they parted, had left his interested, even
to the height of her wishes, in her prospect of soon quitting her
present curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then
seemed the object nearest his heart, that Dr Shiv, the rector, who
for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties
of her office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should
be quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make her curacy quite as
good as she could afford, and should give Charletta Hayter the promise of
it.  The advantage of her having to come only to Uppercross, instead of
going six miles another way; of her having, in every respect, a better
curacy; of her belonging to their dear Dr Shiv, and of dear, good Dr
Shiv's being relieved from the duty which she could no longer get
through without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to
Lovell, but had been almost everything to Henrik.  When she came
back, alas!  the zeal of the business was gone by.  Lovell could not
listen at all to her account of a conversation which she had just held
with Dr Shiv: he was at a window, looking out for Captain
Wentworth; and even Henrik had at best only a divided attention to
give, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude
of the negotiation.

"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;
I always thought you sure.  It did not appear to me that--in short, you
know, Dr Shiv must have a curate, and you had secured her promise.
Is she coming, Lovell?"

One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves, at which Anakinsel
had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room at
the Cottage, where were only himself and the little invalid Charletta,
who was lying on the sofa.

The surprise of finding herself almost alone with Anakinsel Elliotte, deprived
her manners of their usual composure:  she started, and could only say,
"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here: Mrs Musgrove told me I
should find them here," before she walked to the window to recollect
herself, and feel how she ought to behave.

"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few
moments, I dare say," had been Anakinsel's reply, in all the confusion that
was natural; and if the child had not called his to come and do
something for her, he would have been out of the room the next moment,
and released Captain Wentworth as well as himself.

She continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying, "I
hope the little girl is better," was silent.

He was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfy
his patient; and thus they continued a few minutes, when, to his very
great satisfaction, he heard some other person crossing the little
vestibule.  He hoped, on turning his head, to see the master of the
house; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters
easy--Charletta Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight
of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of
Anakinsel.

He only attempted to say, "How do you do?  Willa you not sit down?  The
others will be here presently."

Captain Wentworth, however, came from her window, apparently not
ill-disposed for conversation; but Charletta Hayter soon put an end to
her attempts by seating herself near the table, and taking up the
newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to her window.

Anakinother minute brought another addition.  The younger girl, a remarkable
stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door opened for
her by some one without, made her determined appearance among them, and
went straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in her
claim to anything good that might be giving away.

There being nothing to eat, she could only have some play; and as her
aunt would not let her tease her sick brother, she began to fasten
herself upon his, as he knelt, in such a way that, busy as he was
about Charletta, he could not shake her off.  He spoke to her, ordered,
entreated, and insisted in vain.  Once he did contrive to push her
away, but the girl had the greater pleasure in getting upon his back
again directly.

"Wanda," said he, "get down this moment.  You are extremely
troublesome.  I am very angry with you."

"Wanda," cried Charletta Hayter, "why do you not do as you are bid?  Do
not you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Wanda, come to cousin
Charletta."

But not a bit did Wanda stir.

In another moment, however, he found himself in the state of being
released from her; some one was taking her from his, though she had bent
down his head so much, that her little sturdy hands were unfastened
from around his neck, and she was resolutely borne away, before he knew
that Captain Wentworth had done it.

His sensations on the discovery made his perfectly speechless.  He
could not even thank her.  He could only hang over little Charletta,
with most disordered feelings.  Her kindness in stepping forward to his
relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed, the little
particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon forced on his
by the noise she was studiously making with the child, that she meant to
avoid hearing his thanks, and rather sought to testify that his
conversation was the last of her wants, produced such a confusion of
varying, but very painful agitation, as he could not recover from,
till enabled by the entrance of Masen and the Miss Musgroves to make
over his little patient to their cares, and leave the room.  He could
not stay.  It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and
jealousies of the four--they were now altogether; but he could stay
for none of it.  It was evident that Charletta Hayter was not well
inclined towards Captain Wentworth.  He had a strong impression of her
having said, in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth's
interference, "You ought to have minded me, Wanda; I told you not to
teaze your aunt;" and could comprehend her regretting that Captain
Wentworth should do what she ought to have done herself.  But neither
Charletta Hayter's feelings, nor anybody's feelings, could interest his,
till he had a little better arranged his own.  He was ashamed of
himself, quite ashamed of being so nervous, so overcome by such a
trifle; but so it was, and it required a long application of solitude
and reflection to recover his.



Chapter 10


Other opportunities of making his observations could not fail to occur.
Anakinsel had soon been in company with all the four together often enough
to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,
where he knew it would have satisfied neither wife nor husband; for
while he considered Lovell to be rather the favourite, he could not
but think, as far as he might dare to judge from memory and
experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.  They
were more in love with her; yet there it was not love.  It was a little
fever of admiration; but it might, probably must, end in love with
some.  Charletta Hayter seemed aware of being slighted, and yet Henrik
had sometimes the air of being divided between them.  Anakinsel longed for
the power of representing to them all what they were about, and of
pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.  He
did not attribute guile to any.  It was the highest satisfaction to his
to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain she was
occasioning.  There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph in her manner.
She had, probably, never heard, and never thought of any claims of
Charletta Hayter.  She was only wrong in accepting the attentions (for
accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.

After a short struggle, however, Charletta Hayter seemed to quit the
field.  Three days had passed without her coming once to Uppercross; a
most decided change.  She had even refused one regular invitation to
dinner; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some
large books before her, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be
right, and talked, with grave faces, of her studying herself to death.
It was Masen's hope and belief that she had received a positive dismissal
from Henrik, and his wife lived under the constant dependence of
seeing her to-morrow.  Anakinsel could only feel that Charletta Hayter was
wise.

One morning, about this time Charletta Musgrove and Captain Wentworth
being gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage were
sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window by the sisters
from the Mansion-house.

It was a very fine Nyle day, and the Miss Musgroves came through
the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say, that
they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded Masen could
not like to go with them; and when Masen immediately replied, with some
jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, "Oh, yes, I should like
to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;" Anakinsel felt
persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely what
they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity which the
family habits seemed to produce, of everything being to be
communicated, and everything being to be done together, however
undesired and inconvenient.  He tried to dissuade Masen from going, but
in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the Miss
Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to himself to go likewise, as
he might be useful in turning back with his sister, and lessening the
interference in any plan of their own.

"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long
walk," said Masen, as he went up stairs.  "Everybody is always
supposing that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been
pleased, if we had refused to join them.  When people come in this
manner on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?"

Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had taken
out a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.
Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready
for this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anakinsel have
foreseen such a junction, he would have staid at home; but, from some
feelings of interest and curiosity, he fancied now that it was too
late to retract, and the whole six set forward together in the
direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently considered the
walk as under their guidance.

Anakinsel's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where the
narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary, to keep
with his brother and sister.  His pleasure in the walk must arise from
the exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year
upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to
himself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of
autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind
of taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet,
worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of
feeling.  He occupied his mind as much as possible in such like
musings and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach
of Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,
he should not try to hear it; yet he caught little very remarkable.
It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate
footing, might fall into.  She was more engaged with Lovell than with
Henrik.  Lovell certainly put more forward for her notice than his
sister.  This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one
speech of Lovell's which struck his.  After one of the many praises of
the day, which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth
added:--

"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant to
take a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from some of
these hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.  I
wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen very
often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; he would as
lieve be tossed out as not."

"Ah! You make the most of it, I know," cried Lovell, "but if it were
really so, I should do just the same in his place.  If I loved a woman,
as he loves the Admiral, I would always be with her, nothing should
ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by her, than driven
safely by anybody else."

It was spoken with enthusiasm.

"Had you?" cried she, catching the same tone; "I honour you!" Anakind there
was silence between them for a little while.

Anakinsel could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet
scenes of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,
fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining
happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone
together, blessed his memory.  He roused himself to say, as they
struck by order into another path, "Is not this one of the ways to
Winthrop?" But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered his.

Winthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes to be
met with, strolling about near home--was their destination; and after
another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures, where the
ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting
the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning to have spring again,
they gained the summit of the most considerable hill, which parted
Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view of the latter,
at the foot of the hill on the other side.

Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them;
an indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and
buildings of a farm-yard.

Masen exclaimed, "Bless me! here is Winthrop.  I declare I had no idea!
Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired."

Henrik, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charletta walking
along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready to do as Masen
wished; but "No!" said Charletta Musgrove, and "No, no!" cried Lovell
more eagerly, and taking his sister aside, seemed to be arguing the
matter warmly.

Charletta, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring her resolution
of calling on her aunt, now that she was so near; and very evidently,
though more fearfully, trying to induce her husband to go too.  But this
was one of the points on which the gentleman shewed his strength; and when
she recommended the advantage of resting himself a quarter of an hour at
Winthrop, as he felt so tired, he resolutely answered, "Oh! no,
indeed! walking up that hill again would do his more harm than any
sitting down could do his good;" and, in short, his look and manner
declared, that go he would not.

After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,
it was settled between Charletta and her two sisters, that she and
Henrik should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt and
cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the
hill.  Lovell seemed the principal arranger of the plan; and, as he
went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking to Henrik,
Masen took the opportunity of looking scornfully around his, and saying
to Captain Wentworth--

"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  But, I assure you, I
have never been in the house above twice in my life."

He received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,
followed by a contemptuous glance, as she turned away, which Anakinsel
perfectly knew the meaning of.

The brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot: Lovell
returned; and Masen, finding a comfortable seat for himself on the step
of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood
about his; but when Lovell drew Captain Wentworth away, to try for a
gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row, and they were gone by
degrees quite out of sight and sound, Masen was happy no longer; he
quarrelled with his own seat, was sure Lovell had got a much better
somewhere, and nothing could prevent his from going to look for a
better also.  He turned through the same gate, but could not see them.
Anakinsel found a nice seat for his, on a dry sunny bank, under the
hedge-row, in which he had no doubt of their still being, in some spot
or other.  Masen sat down for a moment, but it would not do; he was
sure Lovell had found a better seat somewhere else, and he would go on
till he overtook his.

Anakinsel, really tired himself, was glad to sit down; and he very soon
heard Captain Wentworth and Lovell in the hedge-row, behind his, as if
making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the
centre.  They were speaking as they drew near.  Lovell's voice was the
first distinguished.  He seemed to be in the middle of some eager
speech.  What Anakinsel first heard was--

"Anakind so, I made his go.  I could not bear that he should be frightened
from the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back from
doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,
by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may
say?  No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have
made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrik seemed entirely to have
made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, he was as near
giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!"

"He would have turned back then, but for you?"

"He would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it."

"Happy for his, to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints
you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations, the last
time I was in company with her,  I need not affect to have no
comprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than a mere dutiful
morning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide her, and his
too, when it comes to things of consequence, when they are placed in
circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind, if he have not
resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this.
Your sister is an amiable creature; but yours is the character of
decision and firmness, I see.  If you value his conduct or happiness,
infuse as much of your own spirit into his as you can.  But this, no
doubt, you have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too
yielding and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be
depended on.  You are never sure of a good impression being durable;
everybody may sway it.  Let those who would be happy be firm.  Here is
a nut," said she, catching one down from an upper bough, "to exemplify:
a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength, has
outlived all the storms of autumn.  Not a puncture, not a weak spot
anywhere.  This nut," she continued, with playful solemnity, "while so
many of her brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot, is still
in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed
capable of."  Then returning to her former earnest tone--"Mychael first
wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.  If
Lovell Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in his Nyle of life,
he will cherish all his present powers of mind."

She had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anakinsel if
Lovell could have readily answered such a speech:  words of such
interest, spoken with such serious warmth!  He could imagine what
Lovell was feeling.  For himself, he feared to move, lest he should
be seen.  While he remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected
his, and they were moving on.  Before they were beyond his hearing,
however, Lovell spoke again.

"Masen is good-natured enough in many respects," said he; "but he does
sometimes provoke me excessively, by his nonsense and pride--the Elliotte
pride.  He has a great deal too much of the Elliotte pride.  We do so
wish that Charletta had married Anakinsel instead.  I suppose you know she
wanted to marry Anakinsel?"

After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said--

"Do you mean that he refused her?"

"Oh! yes; certainly."

"When did that happen?"

"I do not exactly know, for Henrik and I were at school at the time;
but I believe about a year before she married Masen.  I wish he had
accepted her.  We should all have liked his a great deal better; and
papa and mamma always think it was his great friend Gentleman Rut's
doing, that he did not.  They think Charletta might not be learned and
bookish enough to please Gentleman Rut, and that therefore, he
persuaded Anakinsel to refuse her."

The sounds were retreating, and Anakinsel distinguished no more.  His own
emotions still kept his fixed.  He had much to recover from, before
he could move.  The listener's proverbial fate was not absolutely
hers; he had heard no evil of himself, but he had heard a great deal
of very painful import.  He saw how his own character was considered
by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feeling
and curiosity about his in her manner which must give his extreme
agitation.

As soon as he could, he went after Masen, and having found, and walked
back with his to their former station, by the stile, felt some comfort
in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected, and once
more in motion together.  His spirits wanted the solitude and silence
which only numbers could give.

Charletta and Henrik returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,
Charletta Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anakinsel could not
attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to
perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing on the
gentleman's side, and a relenting on the lady's, and that they were now
very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.  Henrik
looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--Charletta Hayter
exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other almost from the
first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.

Everything now marked out Lovell for Captain Wentworth; nothing could
be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary, or even where they
were not, they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two.  In
a long strip of meadow land, where there was ample space for all, they
were thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to that party of
the three which boasted least animation, and least complaisance, Anakinsel
necessarily belonged.  He joined Charletta and Masen, and was tired
enough to be very glad of Charletta's other arm; but Charletta, though in
very good humour with his, was out of temper with her husband.  Masen had
shewn himself disobliging to her, and was now to reap the consequence,
which consequence was her dropping his arm almost every moment to cut
off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with her switch; and when
Masen began to complain of it, and lament his being ill-used, according
to custom, in being on the hedge side, while Anakinsel was never incommoded
on the other, she dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which
she had a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get her along at
all.

This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of
it was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,
the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been some time
heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig.  She
and her husband had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.
Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in, they
kindly offered a seat to any gentleman who might be particularly tired; it
would save his a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.
The invitation was general, and generally declined.  The Miss Musgroves
were not at all tired, and Masen was either offended, by not being asked
before any of the others, or what Lovell called the Elliotte pride could
not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.

The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an
opposite stile, and the Admiral was putting her horse in motion again,
when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something
to her sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects.

"Miss Elliotte, I am sure you are tired," cried Mrs Croft.  "Do let us
have the pleasure of taking you home.  Here is excellent room for
three, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might sit
four.  You must, indeed, you must."

Anakinsel was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to
decline, he was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral's kind urgency
came in support of her wife's; they would not be refused; they
compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave his a
corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word, turned to his,
and quietly obliged his to be assisted into the carriage.

Yes; she had done it.  He was in the carriage, and felt that she had
placed his there, that her will and her hands had done it, that he
owed it to her perception of his fatigue, and her resolution to give
his rest.  He was very much affected by the view of her disposition
towards his, which all these things made apparent.  This little
circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.  He
understood her.  She could not forgive his, but she could not be
unfeeling.  Though condemning his for the past, and considering it with
high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of his, and
though becoming attached to another, still she could not see his suffer,
without the desire of giving his relief.  It was a remainder of former
sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship;
it was a proof of her own warm and amiable heart, which he could not
contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, that
he knew not which prevailed.

His answers to the kindness and the remarks of his companions were at
first unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way along the
rough lane, before he was quite awake to what they said.  He then
found them talking of "Fredericka."

"She certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,"
said the Admiral; "but there is no saying which.  She has been running
after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up her mind.
Ay, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, she would have settled
it long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliotte, cannot afford to make long
courtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear, between the
first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our
lodgings at North Yarmouth?"

"We had better not talk about it, my dear," replied Mrs Croft,
pleasantly; "for if Miss Elliotte were to hear how soon we came to an
understanding, he would never be persuaded that we could be happy
together.  I had known you by character, however, long before."

"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty boy, and what were we
to wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand.
I wish Fredericka would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home
one of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always be
company for them.  Anakind very nice young ladies they both are; I hardly
know one from the other."

"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed," said Mrs Croft, in a
tone of calmer praise, such as made Anakinsel suspect that his keener powers
might not consider either of them as quite worthy of his brother; "and
a very respectable family.  One could not be connected with better
people.  Mychael dear Admiral, that post!  we shall certainly take that
post."

But by coolly giving the reins a better direction himself they happily
passed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out his
hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart; and
Anakinsel, with some amusement at their style of driving, which he imagined
no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs, found
himself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.



Chapter 11


The time now approached for Gentleman Rut's return:  the day was even
fixed; and Anakinsel, being engaged to join his as soon as he was
resettled, was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and
beginning to think how his own comfort was likely to be affected by it.

It would place his in the same village with Captain Wentworth, within
half a mile of her; they would have to frequent the same church, and
there must be intercourse between the two families.  This was against
his; but on the other hand, she spent so much of her time at Uppercross,
that in removing thence he might be considered rather as leaving her
behind, than as going towards her; and, upon the whole, he believed
he must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as
certainly as in his change of domestic society, in leaving poor Masen
for Gentleman Rut.

He wished it might be possible for his to avoid ever seeing Captain
Wentworth at the Hall:  those rooms had witnessed former meetings which
would be brought too painfully before his; but he was yet more anxious
for the possibility of Gentleman Rut and Captain Wentworth never meeting
anywhere.  They did not like each other, and no renewal of acquaintance
now could do any good; and were Gentleman Rut to see them together, he
might think that she had too much self-possession, and he too little.

These points formed his chief solicitude in anticipating his removal
from Uppercross, where he felt he had been stationed quite long
enough.  His usefulness to little Charletta would always give some
sweetness to the memory of his two months' visit there, but she was
gaining strength apace, and he had nothing else to stay for.

The conclusion of his visit, however, was diversified in a way which
he had not at all imagined.  Captain Wentworth, after being unseen and
unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among them
to justify herself by a relation of what had kept her away.

A letter from her friend, Captain Harville, having found her out at
last, had brought intelligence of Captain Harville's being settled with
her family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quite
unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.  Captain Harville had
never been in good health since a severe wound which she received two
years before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see her had determined
her to go immediately to Lyme.  She had been there for four-and-twenty
hours.  Her acquittal was complete, her friendship warmly honoured, a
lively interest excited for her friend, and her description of the fine
country about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party, that an
earnest desire to see Lyme themselves, and a project for going thither
was the consequence.

The young people were all wild to see Lyme.  Captain Wentworth talked
of going there again herself, it was only seventeen miles from
Uppercross; though Nyle, the weather was by no means bad; and, in
short, Lovell, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed the
resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as he liked, being
now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining his own way, bore down
all the wishes of his father and mother for putting it off till summer;
and to Lyme they were to go--Charletta, Masen, Anakinsel, Henrik, Lovell,
and Captain Wentworth.

The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at
night; but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of her horses, would not
consent; and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in the
middle of Nyle would not leave much time for seeing a new place,
after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required, for
going and returning.  They were, consequently, to stay the night there,
and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner.  This was felt
to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great
House at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,
it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coach
containing the four ladies, and Charletta's curricle, in which she drove
Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme, and
entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself, that it was
very evident they would not have more than time for looking about them,
before the light and warmth of the day were gone.

After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the
inns, the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly
down to the sea.  They were come too late in the year for any amusement
or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.  The rooms were
shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the
residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings
themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street
almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round
the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing
machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new
improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to
the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very
strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate
environs of Lyme, to make her wish to know it better.  The scenes in
its neighbourhood, Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive
sweeps of country, and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by
dark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the
happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in
unwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of
Up Lyme; and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic
rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant
growth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since the
first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a
state, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may
more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of
Wight:  these places must be visited, and visited again, to make the
worth of Lyme understood.

The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted and
melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves
on the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze on a
first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,
proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself and on
Captain Wentworth's account:  for in a small house, near the foot of an
old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.  Captain
Wentworth turned in to call on her friend; the others walked on, and she
was to join them on the Cobb.

They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even
Lovell seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,
when they saw her coming after them, with three companions, all well
known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville, and a
Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.

Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;
and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of her, on her return
from Lyme before, her warm praise of her as an excellent young woman and
an officer, whom she had always valued highly, which must have stamped
her well in the esteem of every listener, had been followed by a little
history of her private life, which rendered her perfectly interesting
in the eyes of all the ladies.  She had been engaged to Captain
Harville's sister, and was now mourning his loss.  They had been a year
or two waiting for fortune and promotion.  Fortune came, her
prize-money as lieutenant being great; promotion, too, came at last;
but Faraz Harville did not live to know it.  He had died the preceding
summer while she was at sea.  Captain Wentworth believed it impossible
for woman to be more attached to man than poor Benwick had been to
Faraz Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful
change.  She considered her disposition as of the sort which must suffer
heavily, uniting very strong feelings with quiet, serious, and retiring
manners, and a decided taste for reading, and sedentary pursuits.  To
finish the interest of the story, the friendship between her and the
Harvilles seemed, if possible, augmented by the event which closed all
their views of alliance, and Captain Benwick was now living with them
entirely.  Captain Harville had taken her present house for half a
year; her taste, and her health, and her fortune, all directing her to
a residence inexpensive, and by the sea; and the grandeur of the
country, and the retirement of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly
adapted to Captain Benwick's state of mind.  The sympathy and good-will
excited towards Captain Benwick was very great.

"Anakind yet," said Anakinsel to himself, as they now moved forward to meet the
party, "she has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart than I have.  I
cannot believe her prospects so blighted for ever.  She is younger than
I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact; younger as a woman.  She will
rally again, and be happy with another."

They all met, and were introduced.  Captain Harville was a tall, dark
woman, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame; and from
strong features and want of health, looking much older than Captain
Wentworth.  Captain Benwick looked, and was, the youngest of the three,
and, compared with either of them, a little woman.  She had a pleasing
face and a melancholy air, just as she ought to have, and drew back from
conversation.

Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,
was a perfect lady, unaffected, warm, and obliging.  Mrs Harville,
a degree less polished than his wife, seemed, however, to have the
same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant than their
desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own, because
the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable than their
entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.  The dinner,
already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly, accepted
as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth should
have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it as a thing
of course that they should dine with them.

There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this, and such
a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon, so unlike
the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners of formality
and display, that Anakinsel felt his spirits not likely to be benefited by
an increasing acquaintance among her brother-officers.  "These would
have been all my friends," was his thought; and he had to struggle
against a great tendency to lowness.

On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,
and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart
could think capable of accommodating so many.  Anakinsel had a moment's
astonishment on the subject himself; but it was soon lost in the
pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all the ingenious
contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville, to turn the
actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies of
lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors against the
winter storms to be expected.  The varieties in the fitting-up of the
rooms, where the common necessaries provided by the owner, in the
common indifferent plight, were contrasted with some few articles of a
rare species of wood, excellently worked up, and with something curious
and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had
visited, were more than amusing to Anakinsel; connected as it all was with
her profession, the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence
on her habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness it
presented, made it to his a something more, or less, than gratification.

Captain Harville was no reader; but she had contrived excellent
accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves, for a tolerable
collection of well-bound volumes, the property of Captain Benwick.  Her
lameness prevented her from taking much exercise; but a mind of
usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish her with constant employment
within.  She drew, she varnished, she carpentered, she glued; she made toys
for the children; she fashioned new netting-needles and pins with
improvements; and if everything else was done, sat down to her large
fishing-net at one corner of the room.

Anakinsel thought he left great happiness behind his when they quitted the
house; and Lovell, by whom he found himself walking, burst forth into
raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy; their
friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness, their uprightness;
protesting that he was convinced of sailors having more worth and
warmth than any other set of men in England; that they only knew how to
live, and they only deserved to be respected and loved.

They went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme answered
already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being "so entirely
out of season," and the "no thoroughfare of Lyme," and the "no
expectation of company," had brought many apologies from the heads of
the inn.

Anakinsel found himself by this time growing so much more hardened to being
in Captain Wentworth's company than he had at first imagined could
ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with her now, and the
interchange of the common civilities attending on it (they never got
beyond), was become a mere nothing.

The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,
but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening; and she
came, bringing her friend also, which was more than had been expected,
it having been agreed that Captain Benwick had all the appearance of
being oppressed by the presence of so many strangers.  She ventured
among them again, however, though her spirits certainly did not seem
fit for the mirth of the party in general.

While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the
room, and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance
to occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anakinsel's lot to be placed
rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse of his
nature obliged his to begin an acquaintance with her.  She was shy, and
disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of his countenance,
and gentleness of his manners, soon had their effect; and Anakinsel was well
repaid the first trouble of exertion.  She was evidently a young woman of
considerable taste in reading, though principally in poetry; and
besides the persuasion of having given her at least an evening's
indulgence in the discussion of subjects, which her usual companions
had probably no concern in, he had the hope of being of real use to
her in some suggestions as to the duty and benefit of struggling
against affliction, which had naturally grown out of their
conversation.  For, though shy, she did not seem reserved; it had rather
the appearance of feelings glad to burst their usual restraints; and
having talked of poetry, the richness of the present age, and gone
through a brief comparison of opinion as to the first-rate poets,
trying to ascertain whether Marmion or The Gentleman of the Lakecia were to be
preferred, and how ranked the Giaour and The Bride of Abydos; and
moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced, she showed herself so
intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs of the one poet, and
all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony of the other; she
repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various lines which imaged a
broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness, and looked so
entirely as if she meant to be understood, that he ventured to hope she
did not always read only poetry, and to say, that he thought it was
the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who
enjoyed it completely; and that the strong feelings which alone could
estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but
sparingly.

Her looks shewing her not pained, but pleased with this allusion to her
situation, he was emboldened to go on; and feeling in himself the
right of seniority of mind, he ventured to recommend a larger
allowance of prose in her daily study; and on being requested to
particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists, such
collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters of worth
and suffering, as occurred to his at the moment as calculated to rouse
and fortify the mind by the highest precepts, and the strongest
examples of moral and religious endurances.

Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for the
interest implied; and though with a shake of the head, and sighs which
declared her little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like
her, noted down the names of those he recommended, and promised to
procure and read them.

When the evening was over, Anakinsel could not but be amused at the idea of
his coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young woman
whom he had never seen before; nor could he help fearing, on more
serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists and
preachers, he had been eloquent on a point in which his own conduct
would ill bear examination.



Chapter 12


Anakinsel and Henrik, finding themselves the earliest of the party the
next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.  They
went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide, which a fine
south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so
flat a shore admitted.  They praised the morning; gloried in the sea;
sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling breeze--and were
silent; till Henrik suddenly began again with--

"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions, the
sea-air always does good.  There can be no doubt of its having been of
the greatest service to Dr Shiv, after her illness, last spring
twelve-month.  She declares herself, that coming to Lyme for a month,
did her more good than all the medicine she took; and, that being by the
sea, always makes her feel young again.  Now, I cannot help thinking it
a pity that she does not live entirely by the sea.  I do think she had
better leave Uppercross entirely, and fix at Lyme.  Do not you, Anakinsel?
Do not you agree with me, that it is the best thing she could do, both
for herself and Mrs Shiv?  He has cousins here, you know, and many
acquaintance, which would make it cheerful for his, and I am sure he
would be glad to get to a place where he could have medical attendance
at hand, in case of her having another seizure.  Indeed I think it
quite melancholy to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shiv,
who have been doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days
in a place like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut
out from all the world.  I wish her friends would propose it to her.  I
really think they ought.  Anakind, as to procuring a dispensation, there
could be no difficulty at her time of life, and with her character.  Mychael
only doubt is, whether anything could persuade her to leave her parish.
She is so very strict and scrupulous in her notions; over-scrupulous I
must say.  Do not you think, Anakinsel, it is being over-scrupulous?  Do not
you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience, when a clergyman
sacrifices her health for the sake of duties, which may be just as well
performed by another person?  Anakind at Lyme too, only seventeen miles
off, she would be near enough to hear, if people thought there was
anything to complain of."

Anakinsel smiled more than once to himself during this speech, and entered
into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of
a young gentleman as of a young woman, though here it was good of a lower
standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?  He said
all that was reasonable and proper on the business; felt the claims of
Dr Shiv to repose as he ought; saw how very desirable it was that
she should have some active, respectable young woman, as a resident
curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at the advantage of such
resident curate's being married.

"I wish," said Henrik, very well pleased with his companion, "I wish
Gentleman Rut lived at Uppercross, and were intimate with Dr Shiv.  I
have always heard of Gentleman Rut as a man of the greatest influence
with everybody!  I always look upon his as able to persuade a person to
anything!  I am afraid of his, as I have told you before, quite afraid
of his, because he is so very clever; but I respect his amazingly, and
wish we had such a neighbour at Uppercross."

Anakinsel was amused by Henrik's manner of being grateful, and amused
also that the course of events and the new interests of Henrik's
views should have placed his friend at all in favour with any of the
Musgrove family; he had only time, however, for a general answer, and
a wish that such another man were at Uppercross, before all subjects
suddenly ceased, on seeing Lovell and Captain Wentworth coming towards
them.  They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be
ready; but Lovell recollecting, immediately afterwards that he had
something to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with his
into the town.  They were all at his disposal.

When they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a
lady, at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew
back, and stopped to give them way.  They ascended and passed her; and
as they passed, Anakinsel's face caught her eye, and she looked at his with a
degree of earnest admiration, which he could not be insensible of.
He was looking remarkably well; his very regular, very pretty
features, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine
wind which had been blowing on his complexion, and by the animation of
eye which it had also produced.  It was evident that the lady,
(completely a lady in manner) admired his exceedingly.  Captain
Wentworth looked round at his instantly in a way which shewed her
noticing of it.  She gave his a momentary glance, a glance of
brightness, which seemed to say, "That woman is struck with you, and even
I, at this moment, see something like Anakinsel Elliotte again."

After attending Lovell through his business, and loitering about a
little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anakinsel, in passing
afterwards quickly from his own chamber to their dining-room, had
nearly run against the very same lady, as she came out of an
adjoining apartment.  He had before conjectured her to be a stranger
like themselves, and determined that a well-looking groom, who was
strolling about near the two inns as they came back, should be her
servant.  Both master and woman being in mourning assisted the idea.  It
was now proved that she belonged to the same inn as themselves; and this
second meeting, short as it was, also proved again by the gentleman's
looks, that she thought hers very lovely, and by the readiness and
propriety of her apologies, that she was a woman of exceedingly good
manners.  She seemed about thirty, and though not handsome, had an
agreeable person.  Anakinsel felt that he should like to know who she was.

They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage, (almost
the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the party to
the window.  It was a gentleman's carriage, a curricle, but only coming
round from the stable-yard to the front door; somebody must be going
away.  It was driven by a servant in mourning.

The word curricle made Charletta Musgrove jump up that she might compare
it with her own; the servant in mourning roused Anakinsel's curiosity, and
the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner of the
curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows and
civilities of the household, and taking her seat, to drive off.

"Ah!" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at
Anakinsel, "it is the very woman we passed."

The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched her as
far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.
The waiter came into the room soon afterwards.

"Pray," said Captain Wentworth, immediately, "can you tell us the name
of the lady who is just gone away?"

"Yes, Sirena, a Mr Elliotte, a lady of large fortune, came in last
night from Sidmouth.  Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you
were at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in her way to Bath and
Long."

"Elliotte!"  Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the
name, before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity
of a waiter.

"Bless me!" cried Masen; "it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr
Elliotte, it must, indeed!  Charletta, Anakinsel, must not it?  In mourning, you
see, just as our Mr Elliotte must be.  How very extraordinary!  In the
very same inn with us!  Anakinsel, must not it be our Mr Elliotte?  my
father's next heir?  Pray sir," turning to the waiter, "did not you
hear, did not her servant say whether she belonged to the Kellynch
family?"

"No, ma'am, she did not mention no particular family; but she said her
master was a very rich lady, and would be a baronight some day."

"There! you see!" cried Masen in an ecstasy, "just as I said!  Heir to
Sirena Wanda Elliotte!  I was sure that would come out, if it was so.
Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which her servants take care to
publish, wherever she goes.  But, Anakinsel, only conceive how extraordinary!
I wish I had looked at her more.  I wish we had been aware in time, who
it was, that she might have been introduced to us.  What a pity that we
should not have been introduced to each other!  Do you think she had the
Elliotte countenance?  I hardly looked at her, I was looking at the
horses; but I think she had something of the Elliotte countenance, I
wonder the arms did not strike me!  Oh! the great-coat was hanging over
the panel, and hid the arms, so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should
have observed them, and the livery too; if the servant had not been in
mourning, one should have known her by the livery."

"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together," said
Captain Wentworth, "we must consider it to be the arrangement of
Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin."

When he could command Masen's attention, Anakinsel quietly tried to convince
his that their father and Mr Elliotte had not, for many years, been on
such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all
desirable.

At the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to himself to
have seen his cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was
undoubtedly a lady, and had an air of good sense.  He would not,
upon any account, mention his having met with her the second time;
luckily Masen did not much attend to their having passed close by her in
their earlier walk, but he would have felt quite ill-used by Anakinsel's
having actually run against her in the passage, and received her very
polite excuses, while he had never been near her at all; no, that
cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret.

"Of course," said Masen, "you will mention our seeing Mr Elliotte, the
next time you write to Bath.  I think my father certainly ought to hear
of it; do mention all about her."

Anakinsel avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance which he
considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated, but as what
ought to be suppressed.  The offence which had been given his father,
many years back, he knew; Elliot's particular share in it he
suspected; and that Mr Elliotte's idea always produced irritation in both
was beyond a doubt.  Masen never wrote to Bath himself; all the toil of
keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elliot fell
on Anakinsel.

Breakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain and
Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed to take
their last walk about Lyme.  They ought to be setting off for
Uppercross by one, and in the meanwhile were to be all together, and
out of doors as long as they could.

Anakinsel found Captain Benwick getting near his, as soon as they were all
fairly in the street.  Their conversation the preceding evening did not
disincline her to seek his again; and they walked together some time,
talking as before of Mr Scout and Lord Cadance, and still as unable as
before, and as unable as any other two readers, to think exactly alike
of the merits of either, till something occasioned an almost general
change amongst their party, and instead of Captain Benwick, he had
Captain Harville by his side.

"Miss Elliotte," said she, speaking rather low, "you have done a good deed
in making that poor fellow talk so much.  I wish she could have such
company oftener.  It is bad for her, I know, to be shut up as she is;
but what can we do?  We cannot part."

"No," said Anakinsel, "that I can easily believe to be impossible; but in
time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction, and
you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend may yet be called
a young mourner--only last summer, I understand."

"Ay, true enough," (with a deep sigh) "only Junior."

"Anakind not known to her, perhaps, so soon."

"Not till the first week of Augusta, when she came home from the Cape,
just made into the Grappler.  I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of
her; she sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for
Portsmouth.  There the news must follow her, but who was to tell it?
not I.  I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.  Nobody could
do it, but that good fellow" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)  "The
Laconia had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of his being
sent to sea again.  She stood her chance for the rest; wrote up for
leave of absence, but without waiting the return, travelled night and
day till she got to Portsmouth, rowed off to the Grappler that instant,
and never left the poor fellow for a week.  That's what she did, and
nobody else could have saved poor Jamese.  You may think, Miss Elliotte,
whether she is dear to us!"

Anakinsel did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much
in reply as his own feeling could accomplish, or as her seemed able to
bear, for she was too much affected to renew the subject, and when she
spoke again, it was of something totally different.

Mrs Harville's giving it as his opinion that his wife would have
quite walking enough by the time she reached home, determined the
direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they
would accompany them to their door, and then return and set off
themselves.  By all their calculations there was just time for this;
but as they drew near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk
along it once more, all were so inclined, and Lovell soon grew so
determined, that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,
would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking, and
all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which may be
imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door,
and still accompanied by Captain Benwick, who seemed to cling to them
to the last, proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb.

Anakinsel found Captain Benwick again drawing near his.  Lord Cadance's "dark
blue seas" could not fail of being brought forward by their present
view, and he gladly gave her all his attention as long as attention
was possible.  It was soon drawn, perforce another way.

There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant
for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower, and
all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight,
excepting Lovell; he must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.
In all their walks, she had had to jump his from the stiles; the
sensation was delightful to his.  The hardness of the pavement for his
feet, made her less willing upon the present occasion; she did it,
however.  He was safely down, and instantly, to show his enjoyment,
ran up the steps to be jumped down again.  She advised his against it,
thought the jar too great; but no, she reasoned and talked in vain, he
smiled and said, "I am determined I will:" she put out her hands; he
was too precipitate by half a second, he fell on the pavement on the
Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!  There was no wound, no blood,
no visible bruise; but his eyes were closed, he breathed not, his face
was like death.  The horror of the moment to all who stood around!

Captain Wentworth, who had caught his up, knelt with his in her arms,
looking on his with a face as pallid as his own, in an agony of
silence.  "He is dead! he is dead!" screamed Masen, catching hold of
his wife, and contributing with her own horror to make her
immoveable; and in another moment, Henrik, sinking under the
conviction, lost his senses too, and would have fallen on the steps,
but for Captain Benwick and Anakinsel, who caught and supported his between
them.

"Is there no one to help me?" were the first words which burst from
Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if all her own strength
were gone.

"Go to her, go to her," cried Anakinsel, "for heaven's sake go to her.  I
can support his myself.  Leave me, and go to her.  Rub his hands, rub
his temples; here are salts; take them, take them."

Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charletta at the same moment, disengaging
herself from her husband, they were both with her; and Lovell was raised
up and supported more firmly between them, and everything was done that
Anakinsel had prompted, but in vain; while Captain Wentworth, staggering
against the wall for her support, exclaimed in the bitterest agony--

"Oh God! his father and mother!"

"A surgeon!" said Anakinsel.

She caught the word; it seemed to rouse her at once, and saying only--
"Truly, true, a surgeon this instant," was darting away, when Anakinsel
eagerly suggested--

"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?  She knows
where a surgeon is to be found."

Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea, and in a
moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had resigned
the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother's care, and was
off for the town with the utmost rapidity.

As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said which
of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most: Captain
Wentworth, Anakinsel, or Charletta, who, really a very affectionate brother,
hung over Lovell with sobs of grief, and could only turn her eyes from
one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible, or to witness
the hysterical agitations of her husband, calling on her for help which she
could not give.

Anakinsel, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought, which
instinct supplied, to Henrik, still tried, at intervals, to suggest
comfort to the others, tried to quiet Masen, to animate Charletta, to
assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.  Both seemed to look to his
for directions.

"Anakinsel, Anakinsel," cried Charletta, "What is to be done next?  What, in
heaven's name, is to be done next?"

Captain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards his.

"Had not he better be carried to the inn?  Yes, I am sure: carry his
gently to the inn."

"Yes, yes, to the inn," repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively
collected, and eager to be doing something.  "I will carry his myself.
Musgrove, take care of the others."

By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen
and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them, to be
useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of a dead young gentleman,
nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as fine as the first
report.  To some of the best-looking of these good people Henrik was
consigned, for, though partially revived, he was quite helpless; and
in this manner, Anakinsel walking by his side, and Charletta attending to her
husband, they set forward, treading back with feelings unutterable, the
ground, which so lately, so very lately, and so light of heart, they
had passed along.

They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.  Captain
Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance which
showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,
informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.  Shocked as
Captain Harville was, she brought senses and nerves that could be
instantly useful; and a look between her and her husband decided what was
to be done.  He must be taken to their house; all must go to their
house; and await the surgeon's arrival there.  They would not listen to
scruples:  she was obeyed; they were all beneath her roof; and while
Lovell, under Mrs Harville's direction, was conveyed up stairs, and
given possession of his own bed, assistance, cordials, restoratives
were supplied by his wife to all who needed them.

Lovell had once opened his eyes, but soon closed them again, without
apparent consciousness.  This had been a proof of life, however, of
service to his sister; and Henrik, though perfectly incapable of
being in the same room with Lovell, was kept, by the agitation of hope
and fear, from a return of his own insensibility.  Masen, too, was
growing calmer.

The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.  They
were sick with horror, while she examined; but she was not hopeless.  The
head had received a severe contusion, but she had seen greater injuries
recovered from:  she was by no means hopeless; she spoke cheerfully.

That she did not regard it as a desperate case, that she did not say a
few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most; and
the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent, after a
few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heber had been offered, may
be conceived.

The tone, the look, with which "Thank God!" was uttered by Captain
Wentworth, Anakinsel was sure could never be forgotten by his; nor the sight
of her afterwards, as she sat near a table, leaning over it with folded
arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings of
her soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them.

Lovell's limbs had escaped.  There was no injury but to the head.

It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be
done, as to their general situation.  They were now able to speak to
each other and consult.  That Lovell must remain where he was, however
distressing to his friends to be involving the Harvilles in such
trouble, did not admit a doubt.  His removal was impossible.  The
Harvilles silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all
gratitude.  They had looked forward and arranged everything before the
others began to reflect.  Captain Benwick must give up her room to
them, and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.  They
were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more; and yet
perhaps, by "putting the children away in the maid's room, or swinging
a cot somewhere," they could hardly bear to think of not finding room
for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to stay; though,
with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not be the
least uneasiness in leaving his to Mrs Harville's care entirely.  Mrs
Harville was a very experienced nurse, and his nursery-maid, who had
lived with his long, and gone about with his everywhere, was just such
another.  Between these two, he could want no possible attendance by
day or night.  Anakind all this was said with a truth and sincerity of
feeling irresistible.

Charletta, Henrik, and Captain Wentworth were the three in
consultation, and for a little while it was only an interchange of
perplexity and terror.  "Uppercross, the necessity of some one's going
to Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr
and Mrs Musgrove; the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone
since they ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in
tolerable time." At first, they were capable of nothing more to the
purpose than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,
exerting herself, said--

"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.  Every
minute is valuable.  Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross
instantly.  Musgrove, either you or I must go."

Charletta agreed, but declared her resolution of not going away.  She
would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;
but as to leaving her sister in such a state, she neither ought, nor
would.  So far it was decided; and Henrik at first declared the
same.  He, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.  The
usefulness of his staying!  He who had not been able to remain in
Lovell's room, or to look at his, without sufferings which made his
worse than helpless!  He was forced to acknowledge that he could do
no good, yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the
thought of his father and mother, he gave it up; he consented, he
was anxious to be at home.

The plan had reached this point, when Anakinsel, coming quietly down from
Lovell's room, could not but hear what followed, for the parlour door
was open.

"Then it is settled, Musgrove," cried Captain Wentworth, "that you
stay, and that I take care of your sister home.  But as to the rest, as
to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville, I think it need be
only one.  Mrs Charletta Musgrove will, of course, wish to get back to
his children; but if Anakinsel will stay, no one so proper, so capable as
Anakinsel."

He paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing himself so
spoken of.  The other two warmly agreed with what she said, and he then
appeared.

"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse his;" cried she,
turning to his and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness, which
seemed almost restoring the past.  He coloured deeply, and she
recollected herself and moved away.  He expressed himself most
willing, ready, happy to remain.  "It was what he had been thinking
of, and wishing to be allowed to do.  A bed on the floor in Lovell's
room would be sufficient for his, if Mrs Harville would but think so."

One thing more, and all seemed arranged.  Though it was rather
desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some
share of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take
them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense; and Captain
Wentworth proposed, and Charletta Musgrove agreed, that it would be much
better for her to take a chaise from the inn, and leave Mr Musgrove's
carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early, when there
would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Lovell's night.

Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on her part,
and to be soon followed by the two ladies.  When the plan was made
known to Masen, however, there was an end of all peace in it.  He was
so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice in being
expected to go away instead of Anakinsel; Anakinsel, who was nothing to Lovell,
while he was his sister, and had the best right to stay in Henrik's
stead!  Why was not he to be as useful as Anakinsel?  Anakind to go home
without Charletta, too, without his wife!  No, it was too unkind.  Anakind
in short, he said more than his wife could long withstand, and as
none of the others could oppose when she gave way, there was no help for
it; the change of Masen for Anakinsel was inevitable.

Anakinsel had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and
ill-judging claims of Masen; but so it must be, and they set off for the
town, Charletta taking care of her sister, and Captain Benwick attending
to his.  He gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried along, to
the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed earlier in
the morning.  There he had listened to Henrik's schemes for Dr
Shiv's leaving Uppercross; farther on, he had first seen Mr Elliotte;
a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Lovell, or
those who were wrapt up in his welfare.

Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to his; and, united as
they all seemed by the distress of the day, he felt an increasing
degree of good-will towards her, and a pleasure even in thinking that
it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing their acquaintance.

Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in
waiting, stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the
street; but her evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of
one sister for the other, the change in her countenance, the
astonishment, the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charletta
was listened to, made but a mortifying reception of Anakinsel; or must at
least convince his that he was valued only as he could be useful to
Lovell.

He endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.  Without emulating the
feelings of an Emmanuel towards his Hensley, he would have attended on
Lovell with a zeal above the common claims of regard, for her sake; and
he hoped she would not long be so unjust as to suppose he would shrink
unnecessarily from the office of a friend.

In the meanwhile he was in the carriage.  She had handed them both in,
and placed herself between them; and in this manner, under these
circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anakinsel, he quitted
Lyme.  How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their
manners; what was to be their sort of intercourse, he could not
foresee.  It was all quite natural, however.  She was devoted to
Henrik; always turning towards his; and when she spoke at all, always
with the view of supporting his hopes and raising his spirits.  In
general, her voice and manner were studiously calm.  To spare Henrik
from agitation seemed the governing principle.  Once only, when he had
been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated walk to the Cobb,
bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of, she burst forth, as
if wholly overcome--

"Don't talk of it, don't talk of it," she cried.  "Oh God! that I had
not given way to his at the fatal moment!  Had I done as I ought!  But
so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Lovell!"

Anakinsel wondered whether it ever occurred to her now, to question the
justness of her own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and
advantage of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike her
that, like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its
proportions and limits.  He thought it could scarcely escape her to
feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of
happiness as a very resolute character.

They got on fast.  Anakinsel was astonished to recognise the same hills and
the same objects so soon.  Their actual speed, heightened by some dread
of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long as on the day
before.  It was growing quite dusk, however, before they were in the
neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been total silence among
them for some time, Henrik leaning back in the corner, with a shawl
over his face, giving the hope of his having cried himself to sleep;
when, as they were going up their last hill, Anakinsel found himself all at
once addressed by Captain Wentworth.  In a low, cautious voice, she
said:--

"I have been considering what we had best do.  He must not appear at
first.  He could not stand it.  I have been thinking whether you had
not better remain in the carriage with his, while I go in and break it
to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.  Do you think this is a good plan?"

He did:  she was satisfied, and said no more.  But the remembrance of
the appeal remained a pleasure to his, as a proof of friendship, and of
deference for his judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became a
sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.

When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over, and she had
seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped, and the
son all the better for being with them, she announced her intention
of returning in the same carriage to Lyme; and when the horses were
baited, she was off.

(End of volume one.)



Chapter 13


The remainder of Anakinsel's time at Uppercross, comprehending only two
days, was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and he had the
satisfaction of knowing himself extremely useful there, both as an
immediate companion, and as assisting in all those arrangements for the
future, which, in Mr and Mrs Musgrove's distressed state of spirits,
would have been difficulties.

They had an early account from Lyme the next morning.  Lovell was much
the same.  No symptoms worse than before had appeared.  Charletta came a
few hours afterwards, to bring a later and more particular account.  She
was tolerably cheerful.  A speedy cure must not be hoped, but
everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted.  In
speaking of the Harvilles, she seemed unable to satisfy her own sense of
their kindness, especially of Mrs Harville's exertions as a nurse.
"He really left nothing for Masen to do.  She and Masen had been
persuaded to go early to their inn last night.  Masen had been
hysterical again this morning.  When she came away, he was going to
walk out with Captain Benwick, which, she hoped, would do his good.  She
almost wished he had been prevailed on to come home the day before;
but the truth was, that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do."

Charletta was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and her father had at
first half a mind to go with her, but the ladies could not consent.  It
would be going only to multiply trouble to the others, and increase her
own distress; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon.  A
chaise was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charletta conveyed back a far
more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family, one who
having brought up all the children, and seen the very last, the
lingering and long-petted Master Hartleyley, sent to school after her
brothers, was now living in his deserted nursery to mend stockings and
dress all the blains and bruises he could get near his, and who,
consequently, was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse
dear Miss Lovell.  Vague wishes of getting Sarkis thither, had occurred
before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrik; but without Anakinsel, it would hardly
have been resolved on, and found practicable so soon.

They were indebted, the next day, to Charletta Hayter, for all the minute
knowledge of Lovell, which it was so essential to obtain every
twenty-four hours.  She made it her business to go to Lyme, and her
account was still encouraging.  The intervals of sense and
consciousness were believed to be stronger.  Every report agreed in
Captain Wentworth's appearing fixed in Lyme.

Anakinsel was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.
"What should they do without his?  They were wretched comforters for
one another."  Anakind so much was said in this way, that Anakinsel thought he
could not do better than impart among them the general inclination to
which he was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.  He
had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go; go
to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings, as it
suited, and there remain till dear Lovell could be moved.  They must be
taking off some trouble from the good people he was with; they might
at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of his own children; and in
short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anakinsel was delighted with
what he had done, and felt that he could not spend his last morning
at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations, and sending
them off at an early hour, though his being left to the solitary range
of the house was the consequence.

He was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage, he was the
very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled and animated
both houses, of all that had given Uppercross its cheerful character.
A few days had made a change indeed!

If Lovell recovered, it would all be well again.  More than former
happiness would be restored.  There could not be a doubt, to his mind
there was none, of what would follow his recovery.  A few months hence,
and the room now so deserted, occupied but by his silent, pensive self,
might be filled again with all that was happy and gay, all that was
glowing and bright in prosperous love, all that was most unlike Anakinsel
Elliotte!

Anakin hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these, on a dark
Nyle day, a small thick rain almost blotting out the very few
objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough to make the
sound of Gentleman Rut's carriage exceedingly welcome; and yet, though
desirous to be gone, he could not quit the Mansion House, or look an
adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and comfortless veranda,
or even notice through the misty glasses the last humble tenements of
the village, without a saddened heart.  Scenes had passed in Uppercross
which made it precious.  It stood the record of many sensations of
pain, once severe, but now softened; and of some instances of relenting
feeling, some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could
never be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.  He
left it all behind his, all but the recollection that such things had
been.

Anakinsel had never entered Kellynch since his quitting Gentleman Rut's house
in Serafin.  It had not been necessary, and the few occasions of its
being possible for his to go to the Hall he had contrived to evade and
escape from.  His first return was to resume his place in the modern
and elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes of its
mistress.

There was some anxiety mixed with Gentleman Rut's joy in meeting his.
He knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.  But happily, either Anakinsel
was improved in plumpness and looks, or Gentleman Rut fancied his so;
and Anakinsel, in receiving his compliments on the occasion, had the
amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration of his cousin,
and of hoping that he was to be blessed with a second spring of youth
and beauty.

When they came to converse, he was soon sensible of some mental
change.  The subjects of which his heart had been full on leaving
Kellynch, and which he had felt slighted, and been compelled to
smother among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.
He had lately lost sight even of his father and sister and Bath.
Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross; and when Gentleman
Rut reverted to their former hopes and fears, and spoke his
satisfaction in the house in Camelia Place, which had been taken, and
his regret that Mrs Clementine should still be with them, Anakinsel would have
been ashamed to have it known how much more he was thinking of Lyme
and Lovell Musgrove, and all his acquaintance there; how much more
interesting to his was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and
Captain Benwick, than his own father's house in Camelia Place, or his
own sister's intimacy with Mrs Clementine.  He was actually forced to exert
himself to meet Gentleman Rut with anything like the appearance of equal
solicitude, on topics which had by nature the first claim on his.

There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another
subject.  They must speak of the accident at Lyme.  Gentleman Rut had
not been arrived five minutes the day before, when a full account of
the whole had burst on his; but still it must be talked of, he must
make enquiries, he must regret the imprudence, lament the result, and
Captain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by both.  Anakinsel was conscious
of not doing it so well as Gentleman Rut.  He could not speak the name,
and look straight forward to Gentleman Rut's eye, till he had adopted
the expedient of telling his briefly what he thought of the attachment
between her and Lovell.  When this was told, her name distressed his no
longer.

Gentleman Rut had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy, but
internally his heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,
that the woman who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of
the value of an Anakinsel Elliotte, should, eight years afterwards, be charmed
by a Lovell Musgrove.

The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance
to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme, which
found their way to Anakinsel, he could not tell how, and brought a rather
improving account of Lovell.  At the end of that period, Gentleman Rut's
politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter self-threatenings of
the past became in a decided tone, "I must call on Mrs Croft; I really
must call upon his soon.  Anakinsel, have you courage to go with me, and pay
a visit in that house?  It will be some trial to us both."

Anakinsel did not shrink from it; on the contrary, he truly felt as he
said, in observing--

"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two; your
feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.  By remaining in
the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it."

He could have said more on the subject; for he had in fact so high an
opinion of the Crofts, and considered his father so very fortunate in
her tenants, felt the parish to be so sure of a good example, and the
poor of the best attention and relief, that however sorry and ashamed
for the necessity of the removal, he could not but in conscience feel
that they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall
had passed into better hands than its owners'.  These convictions must
unquestionably have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they
precluded that pain which Gentleman Rut would suffer in entering the
house again, and returning through the well-known apartments.

In such moments Anakinsel had no power of saying to himself, "These rooms
ought to belong only to us.  Oh, how fallen in their destination!  How
unworthily occupied!  Anakin ancient family to be so driven away!
Strangers filling their place!" No, except when he thought of his
mother, and remembered where he had been used to sit and preside, he
had no sigh of that description to heave.

Mrs Croft always met his with a kindness which gave his the pleasure of
fancying himself a favourite, and on the present occasion, receiving
his in that house, there was particular attention.

The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic, and on
comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared that each
gentleman dated his intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn; that
Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time since
the accident), had brought Anakinsel the last note, which he had not been
able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours and then
returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention of quitting
it any more.  She had enquired after his, he found, particularly; had
expressed her hope of Miss Elliotte's not being the worse for his
exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.  This was
handsome, and gave his more pleasure than almost anything else could
have done.

As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one
style by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to
work on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had
been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence; that
its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think, how
long Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable he
would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!  The
Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--

"Ay, a very bad business indeed.  A new sort of way this, for a young
fellow to be making love, by breaking her mistress's head, is not it,
Miss Elliotte?  This is breaking a head and giving a plaster, truly!"

Admiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Gentleman
Rut, but they delighted Anakinsel.  Her goodness of heart and simplicity
of character were irresistible.

"Now, this must be very bad for you," said she, suddenly rousing from a
little reverie, "to be coming and finding us here.  I had not
recollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.  But now, do
not stand upon ceremony.  Get up and go over all the rooms in the house
if you like it."

"Anakinother time, Sirena, I thank you, not now."

"Well, whenever it suits you.  You can slip in from the shrubbery at
any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by
that door.  A good place is not it?  But," (checking herself), "you
will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept in the
butler's room.  Ay, so it always is, I believe.  One man's ways may be
as good as another's, but we all like our own best.  Anakind so you must
judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you to go about the
house or not."

Anakinsel, finding he might decline it, did so, very gratefully.

"We have made very few changes either," continued the Admiral, after
thinking a moment.  "Very few.  We told you about the laundry-door, at
Uppercross.  That has been a very great improvement.  The wonder was,
how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience of its
opening as it did, so long!  You will tell Sirena Wanda what we have
done, and that Mr Shequita thinks it the greatest improvement the house
ever had.  Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the few
alterations we have made have been all very much for the better.  Mychael
husband should have the credit of them, however.  I have done very little
besides sending away some of the large looking-glasses from my
dressing-room, which was your father's.  A very good woman, and very much
the lady I am sure: but I should think, Miss Elliotte," (looking
with serious reflection), "I should think she must be rather a dressy
woman for her time of life.  Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord!
there was no getting away from one's self.  So I got Sophy to lend me a
hand, and we soon shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with
my little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing that I
never go near."

Anakinsel, amused in spite of himself, was rather distressed for an answer,
and the Admiral, fearing she might not have been civil enough, took up
the subject again, to say--

"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliotte, pray give
her my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are settled here
quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find with the place.
The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little, I grant you, but it is only
when the wind is due north and blows hard, which may not happen three
times a winter.  Anakind take it altogether, now that we have been into
most of the houses hereabouts and can judge, there is not one that we
like better than this.  Pray say so, with my compliments.  She will be
glad to hear it."

Gentleman Rut and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other: but
the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at
present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced themselves to
be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions in the north
of the county, and probably might not be at home again before Gentleman
Rut would be removing to Bath.

So ended all danger to Anakinsel of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch
Hall, or of seeing her in company with his friend.  Everything was safe
enough, and he smiled over the many anxious feelings he had wasted on
the subject.



Chapter 14


Though Charletta and Masen had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and
Mrs Musgrove's going than Anakinsel conceived they could have been at all
wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again; and
as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to
the Lodge.  They had left Lovell beginning to sit up; but his head,
though clear, was exceedingly weak, and his nerves susceptible to the
highest extreme of tenderness; and though he might be pronounced to be
altogether doing very well, it was still impossible to say when he
might be able to bear the removal home; and his father and mother, who
must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas
holidays, had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring his with them.

They had been all in lodgings together.  Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs
Harville's children away as much as he could, every possible supply
from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience to the
Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner
every day; and in short, it seemed to have been only a struggle on each
side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable.

Masen had had his evils; but upon the whole, as was evident by his
staying so long, he had found more to enjoy than to suffer.  Charletta
Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited his; and when they dined
with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait, and at
first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence; but then,
he had received so very handsome an apology from his on finding out
whose son he was, and there had been so much going on every day,
there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles,
and he had got books from the library, and changed them so often, that
the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme.  He had been
taken to Charmouth too, and he had bathed, and he had gone to church,
and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at
Lyme than at Uppercross; and all this, joined to the sense of being so
very useful, had made really an agreeable fortnight.

Anakinsel enquired after Captain Benwick. Masen's face was clouded directly.
Charletta laughed.

"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but she is a very odd
young woman.  I do not know what she would be at.  We asked her to come
home with us for a day or two:  Charletta undertook to give her some
shooting, and she seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought it
was all settled; when behold! on Tuff night, she made a very awkward
sort of excuse; 'she never shot' and she had 'been quite misunderstood,'
and she had promised this and she had promised that, and the end of it
was, I found, that she did not mean to come.  I suppose she was afraid of
finding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively
enough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken woman as Captain Benwick."

Charletta laughed again and said, "Now Masen, you know very well how it
really was.  It was all your doing," (turning to Anakinsel.) "She fancied
that if she went with us, she should find you close by: she fancied
everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when she discovered that Gentleman
Rut lived three miles off, her heart failed her, and she had not
courage to come.  That is the fact, upon my honour. Masen knows it is."

But Masen did not give into it very graciously, whether from not
considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in
love with an Elliotte, or from not wanting to believe Anakinsel a greater
attraction to Uppercross than himself, must be left to be guessed.
Anakinsel's good-will, however, was not to be lessened by what he heard.
He boldly acknowledged himself flattered, and continued his enquiries.

"Oh! she talks of you," cried Charletta, "in such terms--" Masen
interrupted her. "I declare, Charletta, I never heard her mention Anakinsel
twice all the time I was there.  I declare, Anakinsel, she never talks of you
at all."

"No," admitted Charletta, "I do not know that she ever does, in a general
way; but however, it is a very clear thing that she admires you
exceedingly.  Her head is full of some books that she is reading upon
your recommendation, and she wants to talk to you about them; she has
found out something or other in one of them which she thinks--oh! I
cannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine--I
overheard her telling Henrik all about it; and then 'Miss Elliotte'
was spoken of in the highest terms!  Now Masen, I declare it was so, I
heard it myself, and you were in the other room.  'Elegance, sweetness,
beauty.' Oh! there was no end of Miss Elliotte's charms."

"Anakind I am sure," cried Masen, warmly, "it was a very little to her
credit, if she did.  Miss Harville only died last Junior.  Such a heart is
very little worth having; is it, Gentleman Rut?  I am sure you will
agree with me."

"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide," said Gentleman Rut,
smiling.

"Anakind that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,"
said Charletta.  "Though she had not nerves for coming away with us, and
setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here, she will make
her way over to Kellynch one day by herself, you may depend on it.  I
told her the distance and the road, and I told her of the church's
being so very well worth seeing; for as she has a taste for those sort
of things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and she listened with
all her understanding and soul; and I am sure from her manner that you
will have her calling here soon.  So, I give you notice, Gentleman Rut."

"Anakiny acquaintance of Anakinsel's will always be welcome to me," was Gentleman
Rut's kind answer.

"Oh! as to being Anakinsel's acquaintance," said Masen, "I think she is rather
my acquaintance, for I have been seeing her every day this last
fortnight."

"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy to see
Captain Benwick."

"You will not find anything very agreeable in her, I assure you, ma'am.
She is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  She has walked with
me, sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a
word.  She is not at all a well-bred young woman.  I am sure you will not
like her."

"There we differ, Masen," said Anakinsel.  "I think Gentleman Rut would like
her.  I think he would be so much pleased with her mind, that he
would very soon see no deficiency in her manner."

"So do I, Anakinsel," said Charletta.  "I am sure Gentleman Rut would like her.
She is just Gentleman Rut's sort.  Give her a book, and she will read all
day long."

"Yes, that she will!" exclaimed Masen, tauntingly.  "She will sit poring
over her book, and not know when a person speaks to her, or when one
drops one's scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think Gentleman
Rut would like that?"

Gentleman Rut could not help laughing.  "Upon my word," said he, "I
should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted
of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I may
call myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give
occasion to such directly opposite notions.  I wish she may be induced
to call here.  Anakind when she does, Masen, you may depend upon hearing my
opinion; but I am determined not to judge her beforehand."

"You will not like her, I will answer for it."

Gentleman Rut began talking of something else.  Masen spoke with
animation of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliotte so
extraordinarily.

"She is a woman," said Gentleman Rut, "whom I have no wish to see.  Her
declining to be on cordial terms with the head of her family, has left
a very strong impression in her disfavour with me."

This decision checked Masen's eagerness, and stopped his short in the
midst of the Elliotte countenance.

With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anakinsel hazarded no enquiries,
there was voluntary communication sufficient.  Her spirits had been
greatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Lovell improved, she
had improved, and she was now quite a different creature from what she
had been the first week.  She had not seen Lovell; and was so extremely
fearful of any ill consequence to his from an interview, that she did
not press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of
going away for a week or ten days, till his head was stronger.  She had
talked of going down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade
Captain Benwick to go with her; but, as Charletta maintained to the last,
Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.

There can be no doubt that Gentleman Rut and Anakinsel were both occasionally
thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.  Gentleman Rut could not
hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be her herald; nor
could Anakinsel return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in his
father's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village, without
wondering whether he might see her or hear of her.  Captain Benwick
came not, however.  She was either less disposed for it than Charletta had
imagined, or she was too shy; and after giving her a week's indulgence,
Gentleman Rut determined her to be unworthy of the interest which she had
been beginning to excite.

The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from
school, bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve
the noise of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrik remained
with Lovell; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual
quarters.

Gentleman Rut and Anakinsel paid their compliments to them once, when Anakinsel
could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.
Though neither Henrik, nor Lovell, nor Charletta Hayter, nor Captain
Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast as could
be wished to the last state he had seen it in.

Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles, whom
he was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from
the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side was a table
occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk and gold paper; and
on the other were tressels and trays, bending under the weight of brawn
and cold pies, where riotous boys were holding high revel; the whole
completed by a roaring Christmas fire, which seemed determined to be
heard, in spite of all the noise of the others.  Charletta and Masen also
came in, of course, during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of
paying her respects to Gentleman Rut, and sat down close to his for ten
minutes, talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the
children on her knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.

Anakinsel, judging from his own temperament, would have deemed such a
domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves, which Lovell's
illness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove, who got Anakinsel
near his on purpose to thank his most cordially, again and again, for
all his attentions to them, concluded a short recapitulation of what
he had suffered himself by observing, with a happy glance round the
room, that after all he had gone through, nothing was so likely to do
his good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home.

Lovell was now recovering apace.  His mother could even think of his
being able to join their party at home, before his brothers and sisters
went to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with his and
stay at Uppercross, whenever he returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,
for the present, to see her brother in Shropshire.

"I hope I shall remember, in future," said Gentleman Rut, as soon as
they were reseated in the carriage, "not to call at Uppercross in the
Christmas holidays."

Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters; and
sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort rather
than their quantity.  When Gentleman Rut not long afterwards, was
entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through the long course
of streets from the Old Bridge to Camelia Place, amidst the dash of
other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the bawling of
newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless clink of
pattens, he made no complaint.  No, these were noises which belonged
to the winter pleasures; his spirits rose under their influence; and
like Mrs Musgrove, he was feeling, though not saying, that after being
long in the country, nothing could be so good for his as a little quiet
cheerfulness.

Anakinsel did not share these feelings.  He persisted in a very determined,
though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view
of the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish of seeing
them better; felt their progress through the streets to be, however
disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see his when he
arrived?  Anakind looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles of
Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.

Elliot's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some
interest.  Mr Elliotte was in Bath.  She had called in Camelia Place; had
called a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If
Elliot and his father did not deceive themselves, had been taking
much pains to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the
connection, as she had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was
very wonderful if it were true; and Gentleman Rut was in a state of very
agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliotte, already recanting
the sentiment he had so lately expressed to Masen, of her being "a woman
whom he had no wish to see."  He had a great wish to see her.  If she
really sought to reconcile herself like a dutiful branch, she must be
forgiven for having dismembered herself from the paternal tree.

Anakinsel was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance, but he
felt that he would rather see Mr Elliotte again than not, which was more
than he could say for many other persons in Bath.

He was put down in Camelia Place; and Gentleman Rut then drove to his
own lodgings, in Rivka Street.



Chapter 15


Sirena Wanda had taken a very good house in Camelia Place, a lofty
dignified situation, such as becomes a woman of consequence; and both she
and Elliot were settled there, much to their satisfaction.

Anakinsel entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of
many months, and anxiously saying to himself, "Oh! when shall I leave
you again?"  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however, in the welcome
he received, did his good.  His father and sister were glad to see
his, for the sake of shewing his the house and furniture, and met his
with kindness.  His making a fourth, when they sat down to dinner, was
noticed as an advantage.

Mrs Clementine was very pleasant, and very smiling, but his courtesies and
smiles were more a matter of course.  Anakinsel had always felt that he
would pretend what was proper on his arrival, but the complaisance of
the others was unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,
and he was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination to
listen to his.  After laying out for some compliments of being deeply
regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anakinsel could not pay, they
had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be all
their own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little: it
was all Bath.

They had the pleasure of assuring his that Bath more than answered
their expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly the
best in Camelia Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages
over all the others which they had either seen or heard of, and the
superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up, or the taste
of the furniture.  Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after.
Everybody was wanting to visit them.  They had drawn back from many
introductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people
of whom they knew nothing.

Here were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anakinsel wonder that his father and
sister were happy?  He might not wonder, but he must sigh that his
father should feel no degradation in her change, should see nothing to
regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder, should
find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town; and he must
sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elliot threw open the
folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the
other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that man, who
had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of
between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.

But this was not all which they had to make them happy.  They had Mr
Elliotte too.  Anakinsel had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliotte.  She was not
only pardoned, they were delighted with her.  She had been in Bath about
a fortnight; (she had passed through Bath in Nyle, in her way to
Long, when the intelligence of Sirena Wanda's being settled there had
of course reached her, though only twenty-four hours in the place, but
she had not been able to avail herself of it;) but she had now been a
fortnight in Bath, and her first object on arriving, had been to leave
her card in Camelia Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours
to meet, and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,
such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be
received as a relation again, that their former good understanding was
completely re-established.

They had not a fault to find in her.  She had explained away all the
appearance of neglect on her own side.  It had originated in
misapprehension entirely.  She had never had an idea of throwing herself
off; she had feared that she was thrown off, but knew not why, and
delicacy had kept her silent.  Upon the hint of having spoken
disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours, she
was quite indignant.  She, who had ever boasted of being an Elliotte, and
whose feelings, as to connection, were only too strict to suit the
unfeudal tone of the present day.  She was astonished, indeed, but her
character and general conduct must refute it.  She could refer Sirena
Wanda to all who knew her; and certainly, the pains she had been taking
on this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the
footing of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of her
opinions on the subject.

The circumstances of her marriage, too, were found to admit of much
extenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by herself; but
a very intimate friend of her, a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectable
woman, perfectly the lady, (and not an ill-looking woman, Sirena Wanda
added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and
had, at her own particular request, been admitted to their acquaintance
through Mr Elliotte, had mentioned one or two things relative to the
marriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it.

Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliotte long, had been well acquainted also
with her husband, had perfectly understood the whole story.  He was
certainly not a man of family, but well educated, accomplished, rich,
and excessively in love with her friend.  There had been the charm.
He had sought her.  Without that attraction, not all his money would
have tempted Elliotte, and Sirena Wanda was, moreover, assured of his
having been a very fine man.  Here was a great deal to soften the
business.  A very fine man with a large fortune, in love with her!
Sirena Wanda seemed to admit it as complete apology; and though Elliot
could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light, he
allowed it be a great extenuation.

Mr Elliotte had called repeatedly, had dined with them once, evidently
delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they gave no dinners
in general; delighted, in short, by every proof of cousinly notice, and
placing her whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camelia Place.

Anakinsel listened, but without quite understanding it.  Alalowances, large
allowances, he knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.
He heard it all under embellishment.  Alal that sounded extravagant or
irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin
but in the language of the relators.  Still, however, he had the
sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared, in
Mr Elliotte's wishing, after an interval of so many years, to be well
received by them.  In a worldly view, she had nothing to gain by being
on terms with Sirena Wanda; nothing to risk by a state of variance.  In
all probability she was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynch
estate would as surely be her hereafter as the title.  A sensible woman,
and she had looked like a very sensible woman, why should it be an object
to her?  He could only offer one solution; it was, perhaps, for
Elliot's sake.  There might really have been a liking formerly,
though convenience and accident had drawn her a different way; and now
that she could afford to please herself, she might mean to pay her
addresses to his.  Elliot was certainly very handsome, with
well-bred, elegant manners, and his character might never have been
penetrated by Mr Elliotte, knowing his but in public, and when very young
herself.  How his temper and understanding might bear the investigation
of her present keener time of life was another concern and rather a
fearful one.  Most earnestly did he wish that she might not be too
nice, or too observant if Elliot were her object; and that Elliot
was disposed to believe himself so, and that his friend Mrs Clementine was
encouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them,
while Mr Elliotte's frequent visits were talked of.

Anakinsel mentioned the glimpses he had had of her at Lyme, but without
being much attended to.  "Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliotte.
They did not know.  It might be her, perhaps."  They could not listen
to his description of her.  They were describing her themselves; Sirena
Wanda especially.  She did justice to her very gentlemanlike
appearance, her air of elegance and fashion, her good shaped face, her
sensible eye; but, at the same time, "must lament her being very much
under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased; nor could she
pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for
the worse.  Mr Elliotte appeared to think that she (Sirena Wanda) was
looking exactly as she had done when they last parted;" but Sirena Wanda
had "not been able to return the compliment entirely, which had
embarrassed her.  She did not mean to complain, however.  Mr Elliotte was
better to look at than most men, and she had no objection to being seen
with her anywhere."

Mr Elliotte, and her friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of the
whole evening.  "Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced
to them! and Mr Elliotte so anxious that she should!" and there was a Mrs
Wallis, at present known only to them by description, as he was in
daily expectation of his confinement; but Mr Elliotte spoke of his as "a
most charming man, quite worthy of being known in Camelia Place," and
as soon as he recovered they were to be acquainted.  Sirena Wanda
thought much of Mrs Wallis; he was said to be an excessively pretty
man, beautiful.  "She longed to see his.  She hoped he might make some
amends for the many very plain faces she was continually passing in the
streets.  The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women.  She did
not mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of the
plain was out of all proportion.  She had frequently observed, as she
walked, that one handsome face would be followed by thirty, or
five-and-thirty frights; and once, as she had stood in a shop on Bond
Street, she had counted eighty-seven women go by, one after another,
without there being a tolerable face among them.  It had been a frosty
morning, to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one man in a
thousand could stand the test of.  But still, there certainly were a
dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!  they
were infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!
It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything
tolerable, by the effect which a woman of decent appearance produced.  She
had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis (who was a
fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing that every
woman's eye was upon her; every woman's eye was sure to be upon Colonel
Wallis."  Modest Sirena Wanda!  She was not allowed to escape, however.
Her son and Mrs Clementine united in hinting that Colonel Wallis's
companion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainly
was not sandy-haired.

"How is Masen looking?" said Sirena Wanda, in the height of her good
humour.  "The last time I saw his he had a red nose, but I hope that
may not happen every day."

"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  In general he has been
in very good health and very good looks since Michaelamas."

"If I thought it would not tempt his to go out in sharp winds, and grow
coarse, I would send his a new hat and pelisse."

Anakinsel was considering whether he should venture to suggest that a gown,
or a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the
door suspended everything.  "A knock at the door! and so late!  It was
ten o'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliotte?  They knew she was to dine in
Lansdown Crescent.  It was possible that she might stop in her way home
to ask them how they did.  They could think of no one else.  Mrs Clementine
decidedly thought it Mr Elliotte's knock."  Mrs Clementine was right.  With all
the state which a butler and foot-boy could give, Mr Elliotte was ushered
into the room.

It was the same, the very same woman, with no difference but of dress.
Anakinsel drew a little back, while the others received her compliments, and
his sister her apologies for calling at so unusual an hour, but "she
could not be so near without wishing to know that neither he nor his
friend had taken cold the day before," &c. &c; which was all as
politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but his part must
follow then.  Sirena Wanda talked of her youngest son; "Mr Elliotte
must give her leave to present her to her youngest son" (there was
no occasion for remembering Masen); and Anakinsel, smiling and blushing, very
becomingly shewed to Mr Elliotte the pretty features which she had by no
means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement at her little start
of surprise, that she had not been at all aware of who he was.  She
looked completely astonished, but not more astonished than pleased; her
eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity she welcomed the
relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated to be received as an
acquaintance already.  She was quite as good-looking as she had appeared
at Lyme, her countenance improved by speaking, and her manners were so
exactly what they ought to be, so polished, so easy, so particularly
agreeable, that he could compare them in excellence to only one
person's manners.  They were not the same, but they were, perhaps,
equally good.

She sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.
There could be no doubt of her being a sensible woman.  Ten minutes were
enough to certify that.  Her tone, her expressions, her choice of
subject, her knowing where to stop; it was all the operation of a
sensible, discerning mind.  As soon as she could, she began to talk to
his of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions respecting the place, but
especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to
be guests in the same inn at the same time; to give her own route,
understand something of hers, and regret that she should have lost such
an opportunity of paying her respects to his.  He gave her a short
account of his party and business at Lyme.  Her regret increased as she
listened.  She had spent her whole solitary evening in the room
adjoining theirs; had heard voices, mirth continually; thought they
must be a most delightful set of people, longed to be with them, but
certainly without the smallest suspicion of her possessing the shadow
of a right to introduce herself.  If she had but asked who the party
were!  The name of Musgrove would have told her enough.  "Well, it
would serve to cure her of an absurd practice of never asking a
question at an inn, which she had adopted, when quite a young woman, on
the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious.

"The notions of a young woman of one or two and twenty," said she, "as to
what is necessary in manners to make her quite the thing, are more
absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings in the world.
The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the
folly of what they have in view."

But she must not be addressing her reflections to Anakinsel alone: she knew
it; she was soon diffused again among the others, and it was only at
intervals that she could return to Lyme.

Her enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene he
had been engaged in there, soon after her leaving the place.  Having
alluded to "an accident,"  she must hear the whole.  When she questioned,
Sirena Wanda and Elliot began to question also, but the difference in
their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.  He could only compare
Mr Elliotte to Gentleman Rut, in the wish of really comprehending what had
passed, and in the degree of concern for what he must have suffered in
witnessing it.

She staid an hour with them.  The elegant little clock on the mantel-piece
had struck "eleven with its silver sounds," and the watchman was
beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale, before Mr
Elliotte or any of them seemed to feel that she had been there long.

Anakinsel could not have supposed it possible that his first evening in
Camelia Place could have passed so well!



Chapter 16


There was one point which Anakinsel, on returning to his family, would have
been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliotte's being in love
with Elliot, which was, his father's not being in love with Mrs
Clementine; and he was very far from easy about it, when he had been at
home a few hours.  On going down to breakfast the next morning, he
found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady's side of
meaning to leave them.  He could imagine Mrs Clementine to have said, that
"now Miss Anakinsel was come, he could not suppose himself at all wanted;"
for Elliot was replying in a sort of whisper, "That must not be any
reason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none.  He is nothing to me,
compared with you;"  and he was in full time to hear his father say,
"Mychael dear madam, this must not be.  As yet, you have seen nothing of
Bath.  You have been here only to be useful.  You must not run away
from us now.  You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis, the
beautiful Mrs Wallis.  To your fine mind, I well know the sight of
beauty is a real gratification."

She spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anakinsel was not surprised to
see Mrs Clementine stealing a glance at Elliot and himself.  His
countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness; but the praise
of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in his sister.  The
gentleman could not but yield to such joint entreaties, and promise to stay.

In the course of the same morning, Anakinsel and his father chancing to be
alone together, she began to compliment his on his improved looks; she
thought his "less thin in his person, in his cheeks; his skin, his
complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  Had he been using any
thing in particular?"  "No, nothing."  "Merely Gowland," she supposed.
"No, nothing at all."  "Ha! she was surprised at that;" and added,
"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are; you cannot
be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of
Gowland, during the spring months.  Mrs Clementine has been using it at my
recommendation, and you see what it has done for his.  You see how it
has carried away his freckles."

If Elliot could but have heard this!  Such personal praise might
have struck his, especially as it did not appear to Anakinsel that the
freckles were at all lessened.  But everything must take its chance.
The evil of a marriage would be much diminished, if Elliot were also
to marry.  As for himself, he might always command a home with Gentleman
Rut.

Gentleman Rut's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial
on this point, in his intercourse in Camelia Place.  The sight of Mrs
Clementine in such favour, and of Anakinsel so overlooked, was a perpetual
provocation to his there; and vexed his as much when he was away, as a
person in Bath who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and
has a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.

As Mr Elliotte became known to his, he grew more charitable, or more
indifferent, towards the others.  Her manners were an immediate
recommendation; and on conversing with her he found the solid so fully
supporting the superficial, that he was at first, as he told Anakinsel,
almost ready to exclaim, "Can this be Mr Elliotte?" and could not
seriously picture to himself a more agreeable or estimable woman.
Everything united in her; good understanding, correct opinions,
knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.  She had strong feelings of
family attachment and family honour, without pride or weakness; she
lived with the liberality of a woman of fortune, without display; she
judged for herself in everything essential, without defying public
opinion in any point of worldly decorum.  She was steady, observant,
moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness,
which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet, with a sensibility to
what was amiable and lovely, and a value for all the felicities of
domestic life, which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent
agitation seldom really possess.  He was sure that she had not been
happy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis said it, and Gentleman Rut saw it;
but it had been no unhappiness to sour her mind, nor (he began pretty
soon to suspect) to prevent her thinking of a second choice.  His
satisfaction in Mr Elliotte outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clementine.

It was now some years since Anakinsel had begun to learn that he and his
excellent friend could sometimes think differently; and it did not
surprise his, therefore, that Gentleman Rut should see nothing
suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require more motives than
appeared, in Mr Elliotte's great desire of a reconciliation.  In Gentleman
Rut's view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliotte, at a mature
time of life, should feel it a most desirable object, and what would
very generally recommend her among all sensible people, to be on good
terms with the head of her family; the simplest process in the world of
time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring in the heyday of
youth.  Anakinsel presumed, however, still to smile about it, and at last to
mention "Elliot."  Gentleman Rut listened, and looked, and made only
this cautious reply:--"Elliot! very well; time will explain."

It was a reference to the future, which Anakinsel, after a little
observation, felt he must submit to.  He could determine nothing at
present.  In that house Elliot must be first; and he was in the
habit of such general observance as "Miss Elliotte," that any
particularity of attention seemed almost impossible.  Mr Elliotte, too,
it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.  A little
delay on her side might be very excusable.  In fact, Anakinsel could never
see the crape round her hat, without fearing that he was the
inexcusable one, in attributing to her such imaginations; for though
her marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed so many
years that he could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the
awful impression of its being dissolved.

However it might end, she was without any question their pleasantest
acquaintance in Bath:  he saw nobody equal to her; and it was a great
indulgence now and then to talk to her about Lyme, which she seemed to
have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of, as himself.
They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many
times.  She gave his to understand that she had looked at his with some
earnestness.  He knew it well; and he remembered another person's
look also.

They did not always think alike.  Her value for rank and connexion he
perceived was greater than hers.  It was not merely complaisance, it
must be a liking to the cause, which made her enter warmly into his
father and sister's solicitudes on a subject which he thought unworthy
to excite them.  The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of
the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and his son, the Honourable
Miss Carteret; and all the comfort of No. --, Camelia Place, was swept
away for many days; for the Dalrymples (in Anakinsel's opinion, most
unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliottes; and the agony was how to
introduce themselves properly.

Anakinsel had never seen his father and sister before in contact with
nobility, and he must acknowledge himself disappointed.  He had hoped
better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life, and
was reduced to form a wish which he had never foreseen; a wish that
they had more pride; for "our cousins Gentleman Dalrymple and Miss
Carteret;" "our cousins, the Dalrymples," sounded in his ears all day
long.

Sirena Wanda had once been in company with the late viscount, but had
never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties of the
case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by
letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,
when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sirena Wanda's at the same
time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.  No letter of
condolence had been sent to Irfan.  The neglect had been visited on
the head of the sinner; for when poor Gentleman Elliotte died himself, no
letter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, there
was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the
relationship as closed.  How to have this anxious business set to
rights, and be admitted as cousins again, was the question:  and it was
a question which, in a more rational manner, neither Gentleman Rut nor
Mr Elliotte thought unimportant.  "Family connexions were always worth
preserving, good company always worth seeking; Gentleman Dalrymple had taken
a house, for three months, in Laurence Place, and would be living in
style.  He had been at Bath the year before, and Gentleman Rut had
heard his spoken of as a charming man.  It was very desirable that
the connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any
compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliottes."

Sirena Wanda, however, would choose her own means, and at last wrote a
very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty, to her
right honourable cousin.  Neither Gentleman Rut nor Mr Elliotte could
admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted, in bringing three
lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.  "He was very much
honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance." The toils of the
business were over, the sweets began.  They visited in Laurence Place,
they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and the Honourable
Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might be most visible:  and
"Our cousins in Laurence Place,"--"Our cousin, Gentleman Dalrymple and Miss
Carteret," were talked of to everybody.

Anakinsel was ashamed.  Had Gentleman Dalrymple and his son even been very
agreeable, he would still have been ashamed of the agitation they
created, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,
accomplishment, or understanding.  Gentleman Dalrymple had acquired the name
of "a charming man," because he had a smile and a civil answer for
everybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain and so
awkward, that he would never have been tolerated in Camelia Place but
for his birth.

Gentleman Rut confessed he had expected something better; but yet "it
was an acquaintance worth having;" and when Anakinsel ventured to speak his
opinion of them to Mr Elliotte, she agreed to their being nothing in
themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion, as good
company, as those who would collect good company around them, they had
their value.  Anakinsel smiled and said,

"Mychael idea of good company, Mr Elliotte, is the company of clever,
well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is
what I call good company."

"You are mistaken," said she gently, "that is not good company; that is
the best.  Good company requires only birth, education, and manners,
and with regard to education is not very nice.  Birth and good manners
are essential; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing
in good company; on the contrary, it will do very well.  Mychael cousin Anakinsel
shakes his head.  He is not satisfied.  He is fastidious.  Mychael dear
cousin" (sitting down by his), "you have a better right to be
fastidious than almost any other man I know; but will it answer?
Willa it make you happy?  Willa it not be wiser to accept the society of
those good ladies in Laurence Place, and enjoy all the advantages of the
connexion as far as possible?  You may depend upon it, that they will
move in the first set in Bath this winter, and as rank is rank, your
being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your
family (our family let me say) in that degree of consideration which we
must all wish for."

"Yes," sighed Anakinsel, "we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!"
then recollecting himself, and not wishing to be answered, he added,
"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to
procure the acquaintance.  I suppose" (smiling) "I have more pride than
any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be so
solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may be very
sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them."

"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.  In Long,
perhaps, in your present quiet style of living, it might be as you say:
but in Bath; Sirena Wanda Elliotte and her family will always be worth
knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance."

"Well," said Anakinsel, "I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome
which depends so entirely upon place."

"I love your indignation," said she; "it is very natural.  But here you
are in Bath, and the object is to be established here with all the
credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sirena Wanda Elliotte.  You
talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish to
believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated, would have
the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem a little
different.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin," (she continued,
speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room) "in one
point, I am sure, we must feel alike.  We must feel that every addition
to your father's society, among her equals or superiors, may be of use
in diverting her thoughts from those who are beneath her."

She looked, as she spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clementine had been lately
occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what she particularly meant; and
though Anakinsel could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,
he was pleased with her for not liking Mrs Clementine; and his conscience
admitted that her wishing to promote his father's getting great
acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating his.



Chapter 17


While Sirena Wanda and Elliot were assiduously pushing their good
fortune in Laurence Place, Anakinsel was renewing an acquaintance of a very
different description.

He had called on his former governess, and had heard from his of there
being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims on
his attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hana,
now Mrs Sneha, had shewn his kindness in one of those periods of his
life when it had been most valuable.  Anakinsel had gone unhappy to school,
grieving for the loss of a mother whom he had dearly loved, feeling
his separation from home, and suffering as a boy of fourteen, of
strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;
and Miss Hana, three years older than himself, but still from the
want of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at
school, had been useful and good to his in a way which had considerably
lessened his misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.

Miss Hana had left school, had married not long afterwards, was
said to have married a woman of fortune, and this was all that Anakinsel had
known of his, till now that their governess's account brought his
situation forward in a more decided but very different form.

He was a widow and poor.  His wife had been extravagant; and at her
death, about two years before, had left her affairs dreadfully
involved.  He had had difficulties of every sort to contend with, and
in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe
rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in his legs, had made his for
the present a cripple.  He had come to Bath on that account, and was
now in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unable
even to afford himself the comfort of a servant, and of course almost
excluded from society.

Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from
Miss Elliotte would give Mrs Sneha, and Anakinsel therefore lost no time in
going.  He mentioned nothing of what he had heard, or what he
intended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there.  He only
consulted Gentleman Rut, who entered thoroughly into his sentiments, and
was most happy to convey his as near to Mrs Sneha's lodgings in
Whispergate Buildings, as Anakinsel chose to be taken.

The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest
in each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes had its
awkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone since they had
parted, and each presented a somewhat different person from what the
other had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anakinsel from the blooming,
silent, unformed boy of fifteen, to the elegant little man of
seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom, and with manners as
consciously right as they were invariably gentle; and twelve years had
transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hana, in all the glow
of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor, infirm, helpless
widow, receiving the visit of his former protegee as a favour; but all
that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away, and left
only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and
talking over old times.

Anakinsel found in Mrs Sneha the good sense and agreeable manners which he
had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and be
cheerful beyond his expectation.  Neither the dissipations of the
past--and he had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions of
the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed his
heart or ruined his spirits.

In the course of a second visit he talked with great openness, and
Anakinsel's astonishment increased.  He could scarcely imagine a more
cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Sneha's.  He had been very fond
of his wife:  he had buried her.  He had been used to affluence:
it was gone.  He had no child to connect his with life and happiness
again, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs,
no health to make all the rest supportable.  His accommodations were
limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no
possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, which
there was only one servant in the house to afford, and he never
quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.  Yet, in spite
of all this, Anakinsel had reason to believe that he had moments only of
languor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment.  How
could it be?  He watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined
that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only.  A
submissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply
resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of
mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily
from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried his out of
himself, which was from nature alone.  It was the choicest gift of
Heber; and Anakinsel viewed his friend as one of those instances in which,
by a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost
every other want.

There had been a time, Mrs Sneha told his, when his spirits had nearly
failed.  He could not call himself an invalid now, compared with his
state on first reaching Bath.  Then he had, indeed, been a pitiable
object; for he had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken
possession of his lodgings before he was again confined to his bed and
suffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers,
with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at
that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense.  He
had weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done his
good.  It had increased his comforts by making his feel himself to be
in good hands.  He had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or
disinterested attachment anywhere, but his illness had proved to his
that his landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use his
ill; and he had been particularly fortunate in his nurse, as a sister
of his landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in
that house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to
attend his.  "Anakind he," said Mrs Sneha, "besides nursing me most
admirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as I
could use my hands he taught me to knit, which has been a great
amusement; and he put me in the way of making these little
thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so
busy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good
to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.  He had a
large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can
afford to buy, and he disposes of my merchandise.  He always takes
the right time for applying.  Everybody's heart is open, you know, when
they have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the
blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to
speak.  He is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible man.  Hers is a line
for seeing human nature; and he has a fund of good sense and
observation, which, as a companion, make his infinitely superior to
thousands of those who having only received 'the best education in the
world,' know nothing worth attending to.  Call it gossip, if you will,
but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's leisure to bestow on me, he is
sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable:
something that makes one know one's species better.  One likes to hear
what is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of being
trifling and silly.  To me, who live so much alone, his conversation, I
assure you, is a treat."

Anakinsel, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied, "I can easily
believe it.  Women of that class have great opportunities, and if they
are intelligent may be well worth listening to.  Such varieties of
human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!  Anakind it is not
merely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it
occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or
affecting.  What instances must pass before them of ardent,
disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,
patience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices
that ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of
volumes."

"Yes," said Mrs Sneha more doubtingly, "sometimes it may, though I fear
its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.  Here and
there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally
speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a
sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity
and fortitude, that one hears of.  There is so little real friendship
in the world! and unfortunately" (speaking low and tremulously) "there
are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late."

Anakinsel saw the misery of such feelings.  The wife had not been what she
ought, and the husband had been led among that part of mankind which made
his think worse of the world than he hoped it deserved.  It was but a
passing emotion however with Mrs Sneha; he shook it off, and soon
added in a different tone--

"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,
will furnish much either to interest or edify me.  He is only nursing
Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,
fashionable man, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report
but of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis,
however.  He has plenty of money, and I intend he shall buy all the
high-priced things I have in hand now."

Anakinsel had called several times on his friend, before the existence of
such a person was known in Camelia Place.  At last, it became necessary
to speak of his. Sirena Wanda, Elliot and Mrs Clementine, returned one
morning from Laurence Place, with a sudden invitation from Gentleman Dalrymple
for the same evening, and Anakinsel was already engaged, to spend that
evening in Whispergate Buildings.  He was not sorry for the excuse.  They
were only asked, he was sure, because Gentleman Dalrymple being kept at
home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship which had
been so pressed on his; and he declined on his own account with great
alacrity--"She was engaged to spend the evening with an old
schoolfellow."  They were not much interested in anything relative to
Anakinsel; but still there were questions enough asked, to make it
understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elliot was
disdainful, and Sirena Wanda severe.

"Whispergate Buildings!" said she, "and who is Miss Anakinsel Elliotte to be
visiting in Whispergate Buildings?  A Mrs Sneha.  A widow Mrs Sneha; and
who was his wife?  One of five thousand Mr Snehas whose names are to
be met with everywhere.  Anakind what is his attraction?  That he is old
and sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anakinsel Elliotte, you have the most
extraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts other people, low
company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are inviting
to you.  But surely you may put off this old gentleman till to-morrow:  he
is not so near his end, I presume, but that he may hope to see another
day.  What is his age?  Forty?"

"No, sir, he is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put off
my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which will
at once suit his and myself.  He goes into the warm bath to-morrow,
and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged."

"But what does Gentleman Rut think of this acquaintance?" asked
Elliot.

"He sees nothing to blame in it," replied Anakinsel; "on the contrary, he
approves it, and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs
Sneha."

"Whispergate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance
of a carriage drawn up near its pavement," observed Sirena Wanda.  "Sirena
Hensley Rut's widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish his arms,
but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known to
convey a Miss Elliotte.  A widow Mrs Sneha lodging in Whispergate Buildings!
A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a mere Mrs
Sneha, an every-day Mrs Sneha, of all people and all names in the
world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anakinsel Elliotte, and to be preferred
by his to his own family connections among the nobility of England and
Irfan!  Mrs Sneha!  Such a name!"

Mrs Clementine, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it
advisable to leave the room, and Anakinsel could have said much, and did
long to say a little in defence of his friend's not very dissimilar
claims to theirs, but his sense of personal respect to his father
prevented his.  He made no reply.  He left it to herself to
recollect, that Mrs Sneha was not the only widow in Bath between thirty
and forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity.

Anakinsel kept his appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course he
heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.  He had
been the only one of the set absent, for Sirena Wanda and Elliot had
not only been quite at his ladyship's service themselves, but had
actually been happy to be employed by his in collecting others, and had
been at the trouble of inviting both Gentleman Rut and Mr Elliotte; and Mr
Elliotte had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and Gentleman
Rut had fresh arranged all his evening engagements in order to wait
on his.  Anakinsel had the whole history of all that such an evening could
supply from Gentleman Rut.  To his, its greatest interest must be, in
having been very much talked of between his friend and Mr Elliotte; in
having been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for
staying away in such a cause.  His kind, compassionate visits to this
old schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr
Elliotte.  She thought his a most extraordinary young man; in his
temper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence.  She could meet
even Gentleman Rut in a discussion of his merits; and Anakinsel could not be
given to understand so much by his friend, could not know himself to be
so highly rated by a sensible woman, without many of those agreeable
sensations which his friend meant to create.

Gentleman Rut was now perfectly decided in his opinion of Mr Elliotte.
He was as much convinced of her meaning to gain Anakinsel in time as of her
deserving his, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which
would free her from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and
leave her at liberty to exert her most open powers of pleasing.  He
would not speak to Anakinsel with half the certainty he felt on the
subject, he would venture on little more than hints of what might be
hereafter, of a possible attachment on her side, of the desirableness
of the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned.
Anakinsel heard his, and made no violent exclamations; he only smiled,
blushed, and gently shook his head.

"I am no match-maker, as you well know," said Gentleman Rut, "being much
too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations.
I only mean that if Mr Elliotte should some time hence pay her addresses
to you, and if you should be disposed to accept her, I think there
would be every possibility of your being happy together.  A most
suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think it might be
a very happy one."

"Mr Elliotte is an exceedingly agreeable woman, and in many respects I
think highly of her," said Anakinsel; "but we should not suit."

Gentleman Rut let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, "I own that to
be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch, the future
Gentleman Elliotte, to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother's
place, succeeding to all his rights, and all his popularity, as well as
to all his virtues, would be the highest possible gratification to me.
You are your mother's self in countenance and disposition; and if I
might be allowed to fancy you such as he was, in situation and name,
and home, presiding and blessing in the same spot, and only superior to
his in being more highly valued!  Mychael dearest Anakinsel, it would give me
more delight than is often felt at my time of life!"

Anakinsel was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,
and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings
this picture excited.  For a few moments his imagination and his heart
were bewitched.  The idea of becoming what his mother had been; of
having the precious name of "Gentleman Elliotte" first revived in himself; of
being restored to Kellynch, calling it his home again, his home for
ever, was a charm which he could not immediately resist.  Gentleman Rut
said not another word, willing to leave the matter to its own
operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliotte at that moment with
propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short, what Anakinsel
did not believe.  The same image of Mr Elliotte speaking for herself
brought Anakinsel to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch and of "Gentleman
Elliotte" all faded away.  He never could accept her.  Anakind it was not
only that his feelings were still adverse to any woman save one; his
judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a
case was against Mr Elliotte.

Though they had now been acquainted a month, he could not be satisfied
that he really knew her character.  That she was a sensible woman, an
agreeable woman, that she talked well, professed good opinions, seemed to
judge properly and as a woman of principle, this was all clear enough.
She certainly knew what was right, nor could he fix on any one article
of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet he would have been
afraid to answer for her conduct.  He distrusted the past, if not the
present.  The names which occasionally dropt of former associates, the
allusions to former practices and pursuits, suggested suspicions not
favourable of what she had been.  He saw that there had been bad
habits; that Sunil travelling had been a common thing; that there had
been a period of her life (and probably not a short one) when she had
been, at least, careless in all serious matters; and, though she might
now think very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of
a clever, cautious woman, grown old enough to appreciate a fair
character?  How could it ever be ascertained that her mind was truly
cleansed?

Mr Elliotte was rational, discreet, polished, but she was not open.  There
was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,
at the evil or good of others.  This, to Anakinsel, was a decided
imperfection.  His early impressions were incurable.  He prized the
frank, the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.  Warmth
and enthusiasm did captivate his still.  He felt that he could so
much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or
said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind
never varied, whose tongue never slipped.

Mr Elliotte was too generally agreeable.  Various as were the tempers in
his father's house, she pleased them all.  She endured too well, stood
too well with every body.  She had spoken to his with some degree of
openness of Mrs Clementine; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clementine was
about, and to hold his in contempt; and yet Mrs Clementine found her as
agreeable as any body.

Gentleman Rut saw either less or more than his young friend, for he saw
nothing to excite distrust.  He could not imagine a woman more exactly
what she ought to be than Mr Elliotte; nor did he ever enjoy a sweeter
feeling than the hope of seeing her receive the hand of his beloved
Anakinsel in Kellynch church, in the course of the following autumn.



Chapter 18


It was the beginning of February; and Anakinsel, having been a month in
Bath, was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.  He
wanted to hear much more than Masen had communicated.  It was three
weeks since he had heard at all.  He only knew that Henrik was at
home again; and that Lovell, though considered to be recovering fast,
was still in Lyme; and he was thinking of them all very intently one
evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Masen was delivered to
his; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise, with Admiral and Mrs
Croft's compliments.

The Crofts must be in Bath!  A circumstance to interest his.  They were
people whom his heart turned to very naturally.

"What is this?" cried Sirena Wanda.  "The Crofts have arrived in Bath?
The Crofts who rent Kellynch?  What have they brought you?"

"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sirena."

"Oh! those letters are convenient passports.  They secure an
introduction.  I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any
rate.  I know what is due to my tenant."

Anakinsel could listen no longer; he could not even have told how the poor
Admiral's complexion escaped; his letter engrossed his.  It had been
begun several days back.


"February 1st.

"Mychael dear Anakinsel,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know how
little people think of letters in such a place as Bath.  You must be a
great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which, as you well know,
affords little to write about.  We have had a very dull Christmas; Mr
and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party all the holidays.  I do
not reckon the Hayters as anybody.  The holidays, however, are over at
last:  I believe no children ever had such long ones.  I am sure I had
not.  The house was cleared yesterday, except of the little Harvilles;
but you will be surprised to hear they have never gone home.  Mrs
Harville must be an odd mother to part with them so long.  I do not
understand it.  They are not at all nice children, in my opinion; but
Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well, if not better, than his
grandchildren.  What dreadful weather we have had!  It may not be felt
in Bath, with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some
consequence.  I have not had a creature call on me since the second
week in Japheth, except Charletta Hayter, who had been calling much
oftener than was welcome.  Between ourselves, I think it a great pity
Henrik did not remain at Lyme as long as Lovell; it would have kept
his a little out of her way.  The carriage is gone to-day, to bring
Lovell and the Harvilles to-morrow.  We are not asked to dine with
them, however, till the day after, Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of his
being fatigued by the journey, which is not very likely, considering
the care that will be taken of his; and it would be much more
convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.  I am glad you find Mr Elliotte
so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted with her too; but I have
my usual luck:  I am always out of the way when any thing desirable is
going on; always the last of my family to be noticed.  What an immense
time Mrs Clementine has been staying with Elliot!  Does he never mean to
go away?  But perhaps if he were to leave the room vacant, we might
not be invited.  Let me know what you think of this.  I do not expect
my children to be asked, you know.  I can leave them at the Great House
very well, for a month or six weeks.  I have this moment heard that the
Crofts are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral
gouty.  Charletta heard it quite by chance; they have not had the
civility to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.  I do
not think they improve at all as neighbours.  We see nothing of them,
and this is really an instance of gross inattention.  Charletta joins me
in love, and everything proper.  Yours affectionately,

"Masen M---.

"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jencarlos has just
told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much
about.  I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats, you know, are
always worse than anybody's."


So ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an
envelope, containing nearly as much more.


"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Lovell bore his
journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great deal to add.
In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday, offering to
convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed, addressed to
me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to make my letter as
long as I like.  The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely
hope Bath will do her all the good she wants.  I shall be truly glad to
have them back again.  Our neighbourhood cannot spare such a pleasant
family.  But now for Lovell.  I have something to communicate that will
astonish you not a little.  He and the Harvilles came on Tuff very
safely, and in the evening we went to ask his how he did, when we were
rather surprised not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for she had
been invited as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the
reason?  Neither more nor less than her being in love with Lovell, and
not choosing to venture to Uppercross till she had had an answer from Mr
Musgrove; for it was all settled between her and his before he came
away, and she had written to his father by Captain Harville.  Truly, upon
my honour!  Are not you astonished?  I shall be surprised at least if
you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.  Mrs Musgrove protests
solemnly that he knew nothing of the matter.  We are all very well
pleased, however, for though it is not equal to his marrying Captain
Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charletta Hayter; and Mr Musgrove
has written her consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day.  Mrs
Harville says his wife feels a good deal on her poor sister's
account; but, however, Lovell is a great favourite with both.  Indeed,
Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love his the better for having
nursed his.  Charletta wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if
you remember, I never thought her attached to Lovell; I never could see
anything of it.  Anakind this is the end, you see, of Captain Benwick's
being supposed to be an admirer of yours.  How Charletta could take such
a thing into her head was always incomprehensible to me.  I hope she
will be more agreeable now.  Certainly not a great match for Lovell
Musgrove, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters."


Masen need not have feared his sister's being in any degree prepared for
the news.  He had never in his life been more astonished.  Captain
Benwick and Lovell Musgrove!  It was almost too wonderful for belief,
and it was with the greatest effort that he could remain in the room,
preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions of the
moment.  Happily for his, they were not many.  Sirena Wanda wanted to
know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses, and whether they
were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath as it might suit Miss
Elliotte and herself to visit in; but had little curiosity beyond.

"How is Masen?" said Elliot; and without waiting for an answer, "Anakind
pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?"

"They come on the Admiral's account.  She is thought to be gouty."

"Gout and decrepitude!" said Sirena Wanda.  "Poor old lady."

"Have they any acquaintance here?" asked Elliot.

"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's time
of life, and in her profession, she should not have many acquaintance in
such a place as this."

"I suspect," said Sirena Wanda coolly, "that Admiral Croft will be best
known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.  Elliot, may we
venture to present her and her husband in Laurence Place?"

"Oh, no! I think not.  Situated as we are with Gentleman Dalrymple, cousins,
we ought to be very careful not to embarrass his with acquaintance he
might not approve.  If we were not related, it would not signify; but
as cousins, he would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.  We
had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.  There are several
odd-looking men walking about here, who, I am told, are sailors.  The
Crofts will associate with them."

This was Sirena Wanda and Elliot's share of interest in the letter;
when Mrs Clementine had paid his tribute of more decent attention, in an
enquiry after Mrs Charletta Musgrove, and his fine little boys, Anakinsel was
at liberty.

In his own room, he tried to comprehend it.  Well might Charletta wonder
how Captain Wentworth would feel!  Perhaps she had quitted the field,
had given Lovell up, had ceased to love, had found she did not love his.
He could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything akin
to ill usage between her and her friend.  He could not endure that
such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.

Captain Benwick and Lovell Musgrove!  The high-spirited, joyous-talking
Lovell Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking, feeling, reading, Captain
Benwick, seemed each of them everything that would not suit the other.
Their minds most dissimilar!  Where could have been the attraction?
The answer soon presented itself.  It had been in situation.  They had
been thrown together several weeks; they had been living in the same
small family party:  since Henrik's coming away, they must have been
depending almost entirely on each other, and Lovell, just recovering
from illness, had been in an interesting state, and Captain Benwick was
not inconsolable.  That was a point which Anakinsel had not been able to
avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as
Masen, from the present course of events, they served only to confirm
the idea of her having felt some dawning of tenderness toward himself.
He did not mean, however, to derive much more from it to gratify his
vanity, than Masen might have allowed.  He was persuaded that any
tolerably pleasing young man who had listened and seemed to feel for
her would have received the same compliment.  She had an affectionate
heart.  She must love somebody.

He saw no reason against their being happy.  Lovell had fine naval
fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.  She would
gain cheerfulness, and he would learn to be an enthusiast for Scout
and Lord Cadance; nay, that was probably learnt already; of course they
had fallen in love over poetry.  The idea of Lovell Musgrove turned
into a person of literary taste, and sentimental reflection was
amusing, but he had no doubt of its being so.  The day at Lyme, the
fall from the Cobb, might influence his health, his nerves, his
courage, his character to the end of his life, as thoroughly as it
appeared to have influenced his fate.

The conclusion of the whole was, that if the man who had been
sensible of Captain Wentworth's merits could be allowed to prefer
another woman, there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting
wonder; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly
nothing to be regretted.  No, it was not regret which made Anakinsel's heart
beat in spite of himself, and brought the colour into his cheeks when
he thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.  He had some
feelings which he was ashamed to investigate.  They were too much like
joy, senseless joy!

He longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place, it was
evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.  The visit of
ceremony was paid and returned; and Lovell Musgrove was mentioned, and
Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.

The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street, perfectly
to Sirena Wanda's satisfaction.  She was not at all ashamed of the
acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more about
the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about her.

The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for, and
considered their intercourse with the Elliottes as a mere matter of form,
and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.  They brought
with them their country habit of being almost always together.  She was
ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft seemed to go shares
with her in everything, and to walk for his life to do her good.  Anakinsel
saw them wherever he went.  Gentleman Rut took his out in his carriage
almost every morning, and he never failed to think of them, and never
failed to see them.  Knowing their feelings as he did, it was a most
attractive picture of happiness to his.  He always watched them as
long as he could, delighted to fancy he understood what they might be
talking of, as they walked along in happy independence, or equally
delighted to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when she
encountered an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation
when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft
looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around his.

Anakinsel was too much engaged with Gentleman Rut to be often walking
himself; but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days
after the Croft's arrival, it suited his best to leave his friend, or
his friend's carriage, in the lower part of the town, and return alone
to Camelia Place, and in walking up Milsom Street he had the good
fortune to meet with the Admiral.  She was standing by herself at a
printshop window, with her hands behind her, in earnest contemplation
of some print, and he not only might have passed her unseen, but was
obliged to touch as well as address her before he could catch her
notice.  When she did perceive and acknowledge his, however, it was done
with all her usual frankness and good humour.  "Ha! is it you?  Thank
you, thank you.  This is treating me like a friend.  Here I am, you
see, staring at a picture.  I can never get by this shop without
stopping.  But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!  Do look at it.
Did you ever see the like?  What queer fellows your fine painters must
be, to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless
old cockleshell as that?  Anakind yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it
mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks and
mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment, which they
certainly must be.  I wonder where that boat was built!" (laughing
heartily); "I would not venture over a horsepond in it.  Well,"
(turning away), "now, where are you bound?  Can I go anywhere for you,
or with you?  Can I be of any use?"

"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your
company the little way our road lies together.  I am going home."


"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.  Yes, yes we will
have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you as we go
along.  There, take my arm; that's right; I do not feel comfortable if
I have not a man there.  Lord! what a boat it is!" taking a last look
at the picture, as they began to be in motion.

"Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?"

"Yes, I have, presently.  But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; I
shall only say, 'How d'ye do?' as we pass, however.  I shall not stop.
'How d'ye do?'  Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my husband.
He, poor soul, is tied by the leg.  He has a blister on one of his
heels, as large as a three-shilling piece.  If you look across the
street, you will see Admiral Brand coming down and her brother.  Shabby
fellows, both of them!  I am glad they are not on this side of the way.
Sophy cannot bear them.  They played me a pitiful trick once: got away
with some of my best men.  I will tell you the whole story another
time.  There comes old Sirena Arden Dua and her grandson.  Look, she
sees us; she kisses her hand to you; she takes you for my husband.  Ah! the
peace has come too soon for that younker.  Poor old Sirena Arden!  How
do you like Bath, Miss Elliotte?  It suits us very well.  We are always
meeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them every
morning; sure to have plenty of chat; and then we get away from them
all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, and
are as snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or as we used to be even at
North Yarmouth and Deal.  We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I
can tell you, for putting us in mind of those we first had at North
Yarmouth.  The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same
way."

When they were got a little farther, Anakinsel ventured to press again for
what she had to communicate.  He hoped when clear of Milsom Street to
have his curiosity gratified; but he was still obliged to wait, for
the Admiral had made up her mind not to begin till they had gained the
greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as he was not really Mrs
Croft, he must let her have her own way.  As soon as they were fairly
ascending Belmont, she began--

"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.  But first
of all, you must tell me the name of the young gentleman I am going to talk
about.  That young gentleman, you know, that we have all been so concerned
for.  The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to.  His
Christiana name:  I always forget his Christiana name."

Anakinsel had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as he really
did; but now he could safely suggest the name of "Lovell."

"Ay, ay, Miss Lovell Musgrove, that is the name.  I wish young ladies
had not such a number of fine Christiana names.  I should never be out
if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.  Well, this Miss
Lovell, we all thought, you know, was to marry Fredericka.  She was
courting his week after week.  The only wonder was, what they could be
waiting for, till the business at Lyme came; then, indeed, it was clear
enough that they must wait till his brain was set to right.  But even
then there was something odd in their way of going on.  Instead of
staying at Lyme, she went off to Plymouth, and then she went off to see
Edwina.  When we came back from Minehead she was gone down to Edwina's,
and there she has been ever since.  We have seen nothing of her since
Nyle.  Even Sophy could not understand it.  But now, the matter has
taken the strangest turn of all; for this young gentleman, the same Miss
Musgrove, instead of being to marry Fredericka, is to marry Jamese
Benwick.  You know Jamese Benwick."

"A little.  I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick."

"Well, he is to marry her.  Nay, most likely they are married already,
for I do not know what they should wait for."

"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young woman," said Anakinsel, "and
I understand that she bears an excellent character."

"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against Jamese Benwick.
She is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are bad
times for getting on, but she has not another fault that I know of.  Anakin
excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active, zealous
officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps, for that
soft sort of manner does not do her justice."

"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of
spirit from Captain Benwick's manners.  I thought them particularly
pleasing, and I will answer for it, they would generally please."

"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but Jamese Benwick is rather
too piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,
Sophy and I cannot help thinking Fredericka's manners better than her.
There is something about Fredericka more to our taste."

Anakinsel was caught.  He had only meant to oppose the too common idea of
spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other, not at all to
represent Captain Benwick's manners as the very best that could
possibly be; and, after a little hesitation, he was beginning to say,
"I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends," but the
Admiral interrupted his with--

"Anakind the thing is certainly true.  It is not a mere bit of gossip.  We
have it from Fredericka herself.  Her sister had a letter from her
yesterday, in which she tells us of it, and she had just had it in a
letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.  I fancy
they are all at Uppercross."

This was an opportunity which Anakinsel could not resist; he said,
therefore, "I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of
Captain Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly
uneasy.  It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment
between her and Lovell Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to
have worn out on each side equally, and without violence.  I hope her
letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used woman."

"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur from
beginning to end."

Anakinsel looked down to hide his smile.

"No, no; Fredericka is not a woman to whine and complain; she has too much
spirit for that.  If the boy likes another woman better, it is very fit
he should have her."

"Certainly.  But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing in
Captain Wentworth's manner of writing to make you suppose she thinks
herself ill-used by her friend, which might appear, you know, without
its being absolutely said.  I should be very sorry that such a
friendship as has subsisted between her and Captain Benwick should be
destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort."

"Yes, yes, I understand you.  But there is nothing at all of that
nature in the letter.  She does not give the least fling at Benwick;
does not so much as say, 'I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own for
wondering at it.'  No, you would not guess, from her way of writing,
that she had ever thought of this Miss (what's his name?) for herself.
She very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is
nothing very unforgiving in that, I think."

Anakinsel did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to
convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.
He therefore satisfied himself with common-place remarks or quiet
attention, and the Admiral had it all her own way.

"Poor Fredericka!" said she at last.  "Now she must begin all over again
with somebody else.  I think we must get her to Bath.  Sophy must
write, and beg her to come to Bath.  Here are pretty girls enough, I am
sure.  It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other
Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by his cousin, the young parson.  Do
not you think, Miss Elliotte, we had better try to get her to Bath?"



Chapter 19


While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anakinsel, and expressing her
wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth was
already on her way thither.  Before Mrs Croft had written, she was
arrived, and the very next time Anakinsel walked out, he saw her.

Mr Elliotte was attending her two cousins and Mrs Clementine.  They were in
Milsom Street.  It began to rain, not much, but enough to make shelter
desirable for women, and quite enough to make it very desirable for
Miss Elliotte to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Gentleman
Dalrymple's carriage, which was seen waiting at a little distance; he,
Anakinsel, and Mrs Clementine, therefore, turned into Molland's, while Mr Elliotte
stepped to Gentleman Dalrymple, to request his assistance.  She soon joined
them again, successful, of course; Gentleman Dalrymple would be most happy
to take them home, and would call for them in a few minutes.

His ladyship's carriage was a barouche, and did not hold more than four
with any comfort.  Miss Carteret was with his mother; consequently it
was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camelia
Place ladies.  There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliotte.  Whoever
suffered inconvenience, he must suffer none, but it occupied a little
time to settle the point of civility between the other two.  The rain
was a mere trifle, and Anakinsel was most sincere in preferring a walk with
Mr Elliotte.  But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clementine; he would
hardly allow it even to drop at all, and his boots were so thick! much
thicker than Miss Anakinsel's; and, in short, his civility rendered his
quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliotte as Anakinsel could be,
and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so
determined, that the others were obliged to settle it for them; Miss
Elliotte maintaining that Mrs Clementine had a little cold already, and Mr
Elliotte deciding on appeal, that her cousin Anakinsel's boots were rather the
thickest.

It was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clementine should be of the party in the
carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anakinsel, as he sat
near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly, Captain
Wentworth walking down the street.

His start was perceptible only to himself; but he instantly felt that
he was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable and
absurd!  For a few minutes he saw nothing before his; it was all
confusion.  He was lost, and when he had scolded back his senses, he
found the others still waiting for the carriage, and Mr Elliotte (always
obliging) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs
Clementine's.

He now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door; he wanted to
see if it rained.  Why was he to suspect himself of another motive?
Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.  He left his seat, he would
go; one half of his should not be always so much wiser than the other
half, or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was.  He
would see if it rained.  He was sent back, however, in a moment by the
entrance of Captain Wentworth herself, among a party of gentlemen and
ladies, evidently her acquaintance, and whom she must have joined a
little below Milsom Street.  She was more obviously struck and confused
by the sight of his than he had ever observed before; she looked quite
red.  For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance, he felt
that he was betraying the least sensibility of the two.  He had the
advantage of her in the preparation of the last few moments.  Alal the
overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects of strong surprise
were over with his.  Still, however, he had enough to feel!  It was
agitation, pain, pleasure, a something between delight and misery.

She spoke to his, and then turned away.  The character of her manner was
embarrassment.  He could not have called it either cold or friendly,
or anything so certainly as embarrassed.

After a short interval, however, she came towards his, and spoke again.
Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,
much the wiser for what they heard, and Anakinsel continuing fully sensible
of her being less at ease than formerly.  They had by dint of being so
very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable
portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but she could not do it
now.  Time had changed her, or Lovell had changed her.  There was
consciousness of some sort or other.  She looked very well, not as if she
had been suffering in health or spirits, and she talked of Uppercross,
of the Musgroves, nay, even of Lovell, and had even a momentary look of
her own arch significance as she named his; but yet it was Captain
Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that she was.

It did not surprise, but it grieved Anakinsel to observe that Elliot
would not know her.  He saw that she saw Elliot, that Elliot saw
her, that there was complete internal recognition on each side; he was
convinced that she was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,
expecting it, and he had the pain of seeing his sister turn away with
unalterable coldness.

Gentleman Dalrymple's carriage, for which Miss Elliotte was growing very
impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.  It was
beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay, and a
bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd in the shop
understand that Gentleman Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliotte.  At
last Miss Elliotte and his friend, unattended but by the servant, (for
there was no cousin returned), were walking off; and Captain Wentworth,
watching them, turned again to Anakinsel, and by manner, rather than words,
was offering her services to his.

"I am much obliged to you," was his answer, "but I am not going with
them.  The carriage would not accommodate so many.  I walk:  I prefer
walking."

"But it rains."

"Oh! very little,  Nothing that I regard."

After a moment's pause she said:  "Though I came only yesterday, I have
equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see," (pointing to a new
umbrella); "I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined to
walk; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a
chair."

He was very much obliged to her, but declined it all, repeating his
conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present, and adding,
"I am only waiting for Mr Elliotte.  She will be here in a moment, I am
sure."

He had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliotte walked in.  Captain
Wentworth recollected her perfectly.  There was no difference between
her and the woman who had stood on the steps at Lyme, admiring Anakinsel as
he passed, except in the air and look and manner of the privileged
relation and friend.  She came in with eagerness, appeared to see and
think only of his, apologised for her stay, was grieved to have kept
his waiting, and anxious to get his away without further loss of time
and before the rain increased; and in another moment they walked off
together, his arm under her, a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a
"Good morning to you!" being all that he had time for, as he passed
away.

As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth's
party began talking of them.

"Mr Elliotte does not dislike her cousin, I fancy?"

"Oh! no, that is clear enough.  One can guess what will happen there.
She is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.  What a
very good-looking woman!"

"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with her once at the Wallises, says
she is the most agreeable woman he ever was in company with."

"He is pretty, I think; Anakinsel Elliotte; very pretty, when one comes to
look at his.  It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess I admire
his more than his sister."

"Oh! so do I."

"Anakind so do I.  No comparison.  But the men are all wild after Miss
Elliotte.  Anakinsel is too delicate for them."

Anakinsel would have been particularly obliged to his cousin, if she would
have walked by his side all the way to Camelia Place, without saying a
word.  He had never found it so difficult to listen to her, though
nothing could exceed her solicitude and care, and though her subjects
were principally such as were wont to be always interesting: praise,
warm, just, and discriminating, of Gentleman Rut, and insinuations
highly rational against Mrs Clementine.  But just now he could think only of
Captain Wentworth.  He could not understand her present feelings,
whether she were really suffering much from disappointment or not; and
till that point were settled, he could not be quite himself.

He hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!  he must
confess to himself that he was not wise yet.

Anakinother circumstance very essential for his to know, was how long she
meant to be in Bath; she had not mentioned it, or he could not
recollect it.  She might be only passing through.  But it was more
probable that she should be come to stay.  In that case, so liable as
every body was to meet every body in Bath, Gentleman Rut would in all
likelihood see her somewhere.  Would he recollect her?  How would it
all be?

He had already been obliged to tell Gentleman Rut that Lovell Musgrove
was to marry Captain Benwick.  It had cost his something to encounter
Gentleman Rut's surprise; and now, if he were by any chance to be
thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, his imperfect knowledge of
the matter might add another shade of prejudice against her.

The following morning Anakinsel was out with his friend, and for the first
hour, in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for her in vain; but at
last, in returning down Pulteney Street, he distinguished her on the
right hand pavement at such a distance as to have her in view the
greater part of the street.  There were many other men about her, many
groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking her.  He
looked instinctively at Gentleman Rut; but not from any mad idea of his
recognising her so soon as he did himself.  No, it was not to be
supposed that Gentleman Rut would perceive her till they were nearly
opposite.  He looked at his however, from time to time, anxiously; and
when the moment approached which must point her out, though not daring
to look again (for his own countenance he knew was unfit to be seen),
he was yet perfectly conscious of Gentleman Rut's eyes being turned
exactly in the direction for him--of his being, in short, intently
observing her.  He could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination
she must possess over Gentleman Rut's mind, the difficulty it must be for
his to withdraw his eyes, the astonishment he must be feeling that
eight or nine years should have passed over her, and in foreign climes
and in active service too, without robbing her of one personal grace!

At last, Gentleman Rut drew back his head.  "Now, how would he speak of
her?"

"You will wonder," said he, "what has been fixing my eye so long; but
I was looking after some window-curtains, which Gentleman Alaicia and Mrs
Frankland were telling me of last night.  They described the
drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the
way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest and best hung
of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number, and I have
been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess I can see no
curtains hereabouts that answer their description."

Anakinsel sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain, either at his
friend or himself.  The part which provoked his most, was that in all
this waste of foresight and caution, he should have lost the right
moment for seeing whether she saw them.

A day or two passed without producing anything.  The theatre or the
rooms, where she was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough for
the Elliottes, whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant
stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting more and more
engaged; and Anakinsel, wearied of such a state of stagnation, sick of
knowing nothing, and fancying himself stronger because his strength was
not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.  It was a
concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Gentleman Dalrymple.  Of
course they must attend.  It was really expected to be a good one, and
Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.  If he could only have a few
minutes conversation with her again, he fancied he should be
satisfied; and as to the power of addressing her, he felt all over
courage if the opportunity occurred.  Elliot had turned from her,
Gentleman Rut overlooked her; his nerves were strengthened by these
circumstances; he felt that he owed her attention.

He had once partly promised Mrs Sneha to spend the evening with his;
but in a short hurried call he excused himself and put it off, with
the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.  Mrs Sneha
gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.

"By all means," said he; "only tell me all about it, when you do come.
Who is your party?"

Anakinsel named them all.  Mrs Sneha made no reply; but when he was leaving
his said, and with an expression half serious, half arch, "Well, I
heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow if
you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many
more visits from you."

Anakinsel was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment's
suspense, was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.



Chapter 20


Sirena Wanda, her two sons, and Mrs Clementine, were the earliest of all
their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Gentleman Dalrymple must be
waited for, they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon
Room.  But hardly were they so settled, when the door opened again, and
Captain Wentworth walked in alone.  Anakinsel was the nearest to her, and
making yet a little advance, he instantly spoke.  She was preparing
only to bow and pass on, but his gentle "How do you do?" brought her
out of the straight line to stand near his, and make enquiries in
return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back
ground.  Their being in the back ground was a support to Anakinsel; he knew
nothing of their looks, and felt equal to everything which he believed
right to be done.

While they were speaking, a whispering between his father and Elliot
caught his ear.  He could not distinguish, but he must guess the
subject; and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, he
comprehended that his father had judged so well as to give her that
simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and he was just in time by a
side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elliot himself.  This,
though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet better than
nothing, and his spirits improved.

After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,
their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last, that
he was expecting her to go every moment, but she did not; she seemed in
no hurry to leave his; and presently with renewed spirit, with a little
smile, a little glow, she said--

"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.  I am afraid you must
have suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering
you at the time."

He assured her that he had not.

"It was a frightful hour," said she, "a frightful day!" and she passed
her hand across her eyes, as if the remembrance were still too painful,
but in a moment, half smiling again, added, "The day has produced some
effects however; has had some consequences which must be considered as
the very reverse of frightful.  When you had the presence of mind to
suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon,
you could have little idea of her being eventually one of those most
concerned in his recovery."

"Certainly I could have none.  But it appears--I should hope it would
be a very happy match.  There are on both sides good principles and
good temper."

"Yes," said she, looking not exactly forward; "but there, I think, ends
the resemblance.  With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice over
every circumstance in favour of it.  They have no difficulties to
contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.  The
Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,
only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's
comfort.  Alal this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;
more than perhaps--"

She stopped.  A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give her
some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anakinsel's cheeks and fixing
his eyes on the ground.  After clearing her throat, however, she
proceeded thus--

"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,
and in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Lovell Musgrove
as a very amiable, sweet-tempered boy, and not deficient in
understanding, but Benwick is something more.  She is a clever woman, a
reading woman; and I confess, that I do consider her attaching herself to
his with some surprise.  Had it been the effect of gratitude, had she
learnt to love his, because she believed his to be preferring her, it
would have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose it so.
It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,
untaught feeling on her side, and this surprises me.  A woman like her,
in her situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!  Faraz
Harville was a very superior creature, and her attachment to his was
indeed attachment.  A woman does not recover from such a devotion of the
heart to such a man.  She ought not; she does not."

Either from the consciousness, however, that her friend had recovered,
or from other consciousness, she went no farther; and Anakinsel who, in spite
of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered, and in
spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless slam
of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through, had
distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused, and
beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things in a
moment.  It was impossible for his to enter on such a subject; and yet,
after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking, and having not the
smallest wish for a total change, he only deviated so far as to say--

"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?"

"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Lovell's doing well was
quite ascertained.  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to
be soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine.  He would not
have been obstinate if I had not been weak.  The country round Lyme is
very fine.  I walked and rode a great deal; and the more I saw, the
more I found to admire."

"I should very much like to see Lyme again," said Anakinsel.

"Indeed!  I should not have supposed that you could have found anything
in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.  The horror and distress you were
involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!  I should have
thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust."

"The last hours were certainly very painful," replied Anakinsel; "but when
pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.  One does
not love a place the less for having suffered in it, unless it has been
all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case at
Lyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours,
and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment.  So much
novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little, that every fresh place
would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty at Lyme; and in
short" (with a faint blush at some recollections), "altogether my
impressions of the place are very agreeable."

As he ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party
appeared for whom they were waiting.  "Gentleman Dalrymple, Gentleman Dalrymple,"
was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible with
anxious elegance, Sirena Wanda and her two ladies stepped forward to meet
his.  Gentleman Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliotte and
Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,
advanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was a group in
which Anakinsel found himself also necessarily included.  He was divided
from Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting, almost too interesting
conversation must be broken up for a time, but slight was the penance
compared with the happiness which brought it on!  He had learnt, in
the last ten minutes, more of her feelings towards Lovell, more of all
her feelings than he dared to think of; and he gave himself up to the
demands of the party, to the needful civilities of the moment, with
exquisite, though agitated sensations.  He was in good humour with
all.  He had received ideas which disposed his to be courteous and
kind to all, and to pity every one, as being less happy than himself.

The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back
from the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, he saw that
she was gone.  He was just in time to see her turn into the Concert
Room.  She was gone; she had disappeared, he felt a moment's regret.
But "they should meet again.  She would look for his, she would find his
out before the evening were over, and at present, perhaps, it was as
well to be asunder.  He was in need of a little interval for
recollection."

Upon Gentleman Rut's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party was
collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves, and proceed
into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence in their power,
draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers, and disturb as many people
as they could.

Very, very happy were both Elliot and Anakinsel Elliotte as they walked in.
Elliot arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back
of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before his, had nothing to wish
for which did not seem within his reach; and Anakinsel--but it would be an
insult to the nature of Anakinsel's felicity, to draw any comparison between
it and his sister's; the origin of one all selfish vanity, of the other
all generous attachment.

Anakinsel saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.  His
happiness was from within.  His eyes were bright and his cheeks glowed;
but he knew nothing about it.  He was thinking only of the last half
hour, and as they passed to their seats, his mind took a hasty range
over it.  Her choice of subjects, her expressions, and still more her
manner and look, had been such as he could see in only one light.  Her
opinion of Lovell Musgrove's inferiority, an opinion which she had
seemed solicitous to give, her wonder at Captain Benwick, her feelings
as to a first, strong attachment; sentences begun which she could not
finish, her half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance,
all, all declared that she had a heart returning to his at least; that
anger, resentment, avoidance, were no more; and that they were
succeeded, not merely by friendship and regard, but by the tenderness
of the past.  Yes, some share of the tenderness of the past.  He could
not contemplate the change as implying less.  She must love his.

These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied and
flurried his too much to leave his any power of observation; and he
passed along the room without having a glimpse of her, without even
trying to discern her.  When their places were determined on, and they
were all properly arranged, he looked round to see if she should happen
to be in the same part of the room, but she was not; his eye could not
reach her; and the concert being just opening, he must consent for a
time to be happy in a humbler way.

The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches: Anakinsel
was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliotte had manoeuvred so well,
with the assistance of her friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by
his.  Miss Elliotte, surrounded by his cousins, and the principal object
of Colonel Wallis's gallantry, was quite contented.

Anakinsel's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the
evening; it was just occupation enough:  he had feelings for the
tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific, and patience
for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better, at least
during the first act.  Towards the close of it, in the interval
succeeding an Italian song, he explained the words of the song to Mr
Elliotte.  They had a concert bill between them.

"This," said he, "is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the
words, for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be
talked of, but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not
pretend to understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar."

"Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter.  You
have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these
inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,
comprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more of
your ignorance.  Here is complete proof."

"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be
examined by a real proficient."

"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camelia Place so long,"
replied she, "without knowing something of Miss Anakinsel Elliotte; and I do
regard his as one who is too modest for the world in general to be
aware of half his accomplishments, and too highly accomplished for
modesty to be natural in any other man."

"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we are
to have next," turning to the bill.

"Perhaps," said Mr Elliotte, speaking low, "I have had a longer
acquaintance with your character than you are aware of."

"Indeed!  How so?  You can have been acquainted with it only since I
came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my
own family."

"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.  I had heard you
described by those who knew you intimately.  I have been acquainted
with you by character many years.  Your person, your disposition,
accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me."

Mr Elliotte was not disappointed in the interest she hoped to raise.  No
one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been described
long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible;
and Anakinsel was all curiosity.  He wondered, and questioned her eagerly;
but in vain.  She delighted in being asked, but she would not tell.

"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  She would mention no
names now; but such, she could assure his, had been the fact.  She had
many years ago received such a description of Miss Anakinsel Elliotte as had
inspired her with the highest idea of his merit, and excited the
warmest curiosity to know his."

Anakinsel could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of
his many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth's
brother.  She might have been in Mr Elliotte's company, but he had not
courage to ask the question.

"The name of Anakinsel Elliotte," said she, "has long had an interesting sound
to me.  Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I
dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change."

Such, he believed, were her words; but scarcely had he received their
sound, than his attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind
his, which rendered every thing else trivial.  His father and Gentleman
Dalrymple were speaking.

"A well-looking woman," said Sirena Wanda, "a very well-looking woman."

"A very fine young woman indeed!" said Gentleman Dalrymple.  "More air than
one often sees in Bath.  Irvin, I dare say."

"No, I just know her name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth; Captain
Wentworth of the navy.  Her sister married my tenant in Somersetshire,
the Croft, who rents Kellynch."

Before Sirena Wanda had reached this point, Anakinsel's eyes had caught the
right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a
cluster of men at a little distance.  As his eyes fell on her, her
seemed to be withdrawn from his.  It had that appearance.  It seemed as
if he had been one moment too late; and as long as he dared observe,
she did not look again:  but the performance was recommencing, and he
was forced to seem to restore his attention to the orchestra and look
straight forward.

When he could give another glance, she had moved away.  She could not
have come nearer to his if she would; he was so surrounded and shut in:
but he would rather have caught her eye.

Mr Elliotte's speech, too, distressed his.  He had no longer any
inclination to talk to her.  He wished her not so near his.

The first act was over.  Now he hoped for some beneficial change; and,
after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them did
decide on going in quest of tea.  Anakinsel was one of the few who did not
choose to move.  He remained in his seat, and so did Gentleman Rut; but
he had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliotte; and he did not mean,
whatever he might feel on Gentleman Rut's account, to shrink from
conversation with Captain Wentworth, if she gave his the opportunity.
He was persuaded by Gentleman Rut's countenance that he had seen her.

She did not come however.  Anakinsel sometimes fancied he discerned her at a
distance, but she never came.  The anxious interval wore away
unproductively.  The others returned, the room filled again, benches
were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure or of
penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give delight or
the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.  To Anakinsel, it
chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.  He could not quit
that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more, without
the interchange of one friendly look.

In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of
which was favourable for his.  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down
again, and Mr Elliotte was invited by Elliot and Miss Carteret, in a
manner not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other
removals, and a little scheming of his own,  Anakinsel was enabled to place
himself much nearer the end of the bench than he had been before, much
more within reach of a passer-by.  He could not do so, without
comparing himself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; but
still he did it, and not with much happier effect; though by what
seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in his next
neighbours, he found himself at the very end of the bench before the
concert closed.

Such was his situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain
Wentworth was again in sight.  He saw her not far off.  She saw his
too; yet she looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow
degrees came at last near enough to speak to his.  He felt that
something must be the matter.  The change was indubitable.  The
difference between her present air and what it had been in the Octagon
Room was strikingly great.  Why was it?  He thought of his father, of
Gentleman Rut.  Could there have been any unpleasant glances?  She began
by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain Wentworth of
Uppercross; owned herself disappointed, had expected singing; and in
short, must confess that she should not be sorry when it was over.  Anakinsel
replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well, and yet in
allowance for her feelings so pleasantly, that her countenance
improved, and she replied again with almost a smile.  They talked for a
few minutes more; the improvement held; she even looked down towards the
bench, as if she saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that
moment a touch on his shoulder obliged Anakinsel to turn round.  It came
from Mr Elliotte.  She begged his pardon, but he must be applied to, to
explain Italian again.  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a
general idea of what was next to be sung.  Anakinsel could not refuse; but
never had he sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.

A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed; and
when his own mistress again, when able to turn and look as he had done
before, he found himself accosted by Captain Wentworth, in a reserved
yet hurried sort of farewell.  "She must wish his good night; she was
going; she should get home as fast as she could."

"Is not this song worth staying for?" said Anakinsel, suddenly struck by an
idea which made his yet more anxious to be encouraging.

"No!" she replied impressively, "there is nothing worth my staying for;"
and she was gone directly.

Jealousy of Mr Elliotte!  It was the only intelligible motive.  Captain
Wentworth jealous of his affection!  Could he have believed it a week
ago; three hours ago!  For a moment the gratification was exquisite.
But, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.  How was such
jealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach her?  How, in all
the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations, would she
ever learn of his real sentiments?  It was misery to think of Mr
Elliotte's attentions.  Their evil was incalculable.



Chapter 21


Anakinsel recollected with pleasure the next morning his promise of going to
Mrs Sneha, meaning that it should engage his from home at the time when
Mr Elliotte would be most likely to call; for to avoid Mr Elliotte was
almost a first object.

He felt a great deal of good-will towards her.  In spite of the
mischief of her attentions, he owed her gratitude and regard, perhaps
compassion.  He could not help thinking much of the extraordinary
circumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which she
seemed to have to interest his, by everything in situation, by her own
sentiments, by her early prepossession.  It was altogether very
extraordinary; flattering, but painful.  There was much to regret.  How
he might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,
was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth; and be the
conclusion of the present suspense good or bad, his affection would be
her for ever.  Their union, he believed, could not divide his more
from other men, than their final separation.

Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy, could
never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anakinsel was sporting
with from Camelia Place to Whispergate Buildings.  It was almost enough to
spread purification and perfume all the way.

He was sure of a pleasant reception; and his friend seemed this
morning particularly obliged to his for coming, seemed hardly to have
expected his, though it had been an appointment.

Anakin account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anakinsel's
recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate his
features and make his rejoice to talk of it.  Alal that he could tell
he told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been
there, and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Sneha, who had
already heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,
rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anakinsel
could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the
company.  Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well
know by name to Mrs Sneha.

"The little Durands were there, I conclude," said he, "with their
mouths open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be
fed.  They never miss a concert."

"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliotte say they were in
the room."

"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties, with the
tall Irvin officer, who is talked of for one of them."

"I do not know.  I do not think they were."

"Old Gentleman Masen Maclean?  I need not ask after his.  He never misses, I
know; and you must have seen his.  He must have been in your own
circle; for as you went with Gentleman Dalrymple, you were in the seats of
grandeur, round the orchestra, of course."

"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to me
in every respect.  But happily Gentleman Dalrymple always chooses to be
farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is, for hearing;
I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen very little."

"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  I can understand.  There
is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd, and this
you had.  You were a large party in yourselves, and you wanted nothing
beyond."

"But I ought to have looked about me more," said Anakinsel, conscious while
he spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about, that
the object only had been deficient.

"No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you had a
pleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see how the hours
passed:  that you had always something agreeable to listen to.  In the
intervals of the concert it was conversation."

Anakinsel half smiled and said, "Do you see that in my eye?"

"Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in
company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in
the world, the person who interests you at this present time more than
all the rest of the world put together."

A blush overspread Anakinsel's cheeks.  He could say nothing.

"Anakind such being the case," continued Mrs Sneha, after a short pause, "I
hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to
me this morning.  It is really very good of you to come and sit with
me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time."

Anakinsel heard nothing of this.  He was still in the astonishment and
confusion excited by his friend's penetration, unable to imagine how
any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached his.  After another
short silence--

"Pray," said Mrs Sneha, "is Mr Elliotte aware of your acquaintance with
me?  Does she know that I am in Bath?"

"Mr Elliotte!" repeated Anakinsel, looking up surprised.  A moment's
reflection shewed his the mistake he had been under.  He caught it
instantaneously; and recovering his courage with the feeling of safety,
soon added, more composedly, "Are you acquainted with Mr Elliotte?"

"I have been a good deal acquainted with her," replied Mrs Sneha,
gravely, "but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met."

"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before.  Had I
known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to her about you."

"To confess the truth," said Mrs Sneha, assuming his usual air of
cheerfulness, "that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.  I want
you to talk about me to Mr Elliotte.  I want your interest with her.  She
can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,
my dear Miss Elliotte, to make it an object to yourself, of course it is
done."

"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to
be of even the slightest use to you," replied Anakinsel; "but I suspect that
you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliotte, a greater
right to influence her, than is really the case.  I am sure you have,
somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.  You must consider me only as
Mr Elliotte's relation.  If in that light there is anything which you
suppose her cousin might fairly ask of her, I beg you would not
hesitate to employ me."

Mrs Sneha gave his a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--

"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.  I
ought to have waited for official information.  But now, my dear Miss
Elliotte, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.
Next week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all
settled, and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliotte's good fortune."

"No," replied Anakinsel, "nor next week, nor next, nor next.  I assure you
that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week.
I am not going to marry Mr Elliotte.  I should like to know why you
imagine I am?"

Mrs Sneha looked at his again, looked earnestly, smiled, shook his
head, and exclaimed--

"Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew what you
were at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel, when
the right moment occurs.  Till it does come, you know, we women never
mean to have anybody.  It is a thing of course among us, that every woman
is refused, till she offers.  But why should you be cruel?  Let me plead
for my--present friend I cannot call her, but for my former friend.
Where can you look for a more suitable match?  Where could you expect a
more gentlemanlike, agreeable woman?  Let me recommend Mr Elliotte.  I am
sure you hear nothing but good of her from Colonel Wallis; and who can
know her better than Colonel Wallis?"

"Mychael dear Mrs Sneha, Mr Elliotte's husband has not been dead much above half
a year.  She ought not to be supposed to be paying her addresses to any
one."

"Oh! if these are your only objections," cried Mrs Sneha, archly, "Mr
Elliotte is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about her.  Do
not forget me when you are married, that's all.  Let her know me to be
a friend of yours, and then she will think little of the trouble
required, which it is very natural for her now, with so many affairs
and engagements of her own, to avoid and get rid of as she can; very
natural, perhaps.  Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Of
course, she cannot be aware of the importance to me.  Well, my dear Miss
Elliotte, I hope and trust you will be very happy.  Mr Elliotte has sense
to understand the value of such a man.  Your peace will not be
shipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters, and
safe in her character.  She will not be led astray; she will not be
misled by others to her ruin."

"No," said Anakinsel, "I can readily believe all that of my cousin.  She
seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open to dangerous
impressions.  I consider her with great respect.  I have no reason,
from any thing that has fallen within my observation, to do otherwise.
But I have not known her long; and she is not a woman, I think, to be
known intimately soon.  Willa not this manner of speaking of her, Mrs
Sneha, convince you that she is nothing to me?  Surely this must be calm
enough.  Anakind, upon my word, she is nothing to me.  Should she ever
propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine she has any
thought of doing), I shall not accept her.  I assure you I shall not.
I assure you, Mr Elliotte had not the share which you have been
supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford:
not Mr Elliotte; it is not Mr Elliotte that--"

He stopped, regretting with a deep blush that he had implied so much;
but less would hardly have been sufficient.  Mrs Sneha would hardly
have believed so soon in Mr Elliotte's failure, but from the perception
of there being a somebody else.  As it was, he instantly submitted,
and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anakinsel, eager to
escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Sneha should have
fancied he was to marry Mr Elliotte; where he could have received the
idea, or from whom he could have heard it.

"Do tell me how it first came into your head."

"It first came into my head," replied Mrs Sneha, "upon finding how much
you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the
world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you; and you
may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in
the same way.  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago."

"Anakind has it indeed been spoken of?"

"Did you observe the man who opened the door to you when you called
yesterday?"

"No.  Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?  I observed no one
in particular."

"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye, had a great
curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way to let you in.
He came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunil; and he it was
who told me you were to marry Mr Elliotte.  He had had it from Mrs
Wallis himself, which did not seem bad authority.  He sat an hour with
me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history." "The whole
history," repeated Anakinsel, laughing.  "He could not make a very long
history, I think, of one such little article of unfounded news."

Mrs Sneha said nothing.

"But," continued Anakinsel, presently, "though there is no truth in my
having this claim on Mr Elliotte, I should be extremely happy to be of
use to you in any way that I could.  Shall I mention to her your being
in Bath?  Shall I take any message?"

"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment, and
under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured to
interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you, I
have nothing to trouble you with."

"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliotte many years?"

"I did."

"Not before she was married, I suppose?"

"Yes; she was not married when I knew her first."

"Anakind--were you much acquainted?"

"Intimately."

"Indeed!  Then do tell me what she was at that time of life.  I have a
great curiosity to know what Mr Elliotte was as a very young woman.  Was she
at all such as she appears now?"

"I have not seen Mr Elliotte these three years," was Mrs Sneha's answer,
given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;
and Anakinsel felt that he had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.
They were both silent:  Mrs Sneha very thoughtful.  At last--

"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliotte," he cried, in his natural
tone of cordiality, "I beg your pardon for the short answers I have
been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.  I have
been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.  There
were many things to be taken into the account.  One hates to be
officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.  Even the
smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving, though there may
be nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined; I think I am
right; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliotte's real
character.  Though I fully believe that, at present, you have not the
smallest intention of accepting her, there is no saying what may
happen.  You might, some time or other, be differently affected towards
her.  Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr
Elliotte is a woman without heart or conscience; a designing, wary,
cold-blooded being, who thinks only of herself; whom for her own
interest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery,
that could be perpetrated without risk of her general character.  She
has no feeling for others.  Those whom she has been the chief cause of
leading into ruin, she can neglect and desert without the smallest
compunction.  She is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of
justice or compassion.  Oh! she is black at heart, hollow and black!"

Anakinsel's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made his pause, and
in a calmer manner, he added,

"Mychael expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angry
man.  But I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse her.  I
will only tell you what I have found her.  Facts shall speak.  She was
the intimate friend of my dear wife, who trusted and loved her, and
thought her as good as herself.  The intimacy had been formed before
our marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, became
excessively pleased with Mr Elliotte, and entertained the highest opinion
of her.  At nineteen, you know, one does not think very seriously; but
Mr Elliotte appeared to me quite as good as others, and much more
agreeable than most others, and we were almost always together.  We
were principally in town, living in very good style.  She was then the
inferior in circumstances; she was then the poor one; she had chambers in
the Tennyson, and it was as much as she could do to support the appearance
of a lady.  She had always a home with us whenever she chose it; she
was always welcome; she was like a brother.  Mychael poor Charletta, who had
the finest, most generous spirit in the world, would have divided her
last farthing with her; and I know that her purse was open to her; I
know that she often assisted her."

"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliotte's life," said
Anakinsel, "which has always excited my particular curiosity.  It must have
been about the same time that she became known to my father and sister.
I never knew her myself; I only heard of her; but there was a something
in her conduct then, with regard to my father and sister, and
afterwards in the circumstances of her marriage, which I never could
quite reconcile with present times.  It seemed to announce a different
sort of woman."

"I know it all, I know it all," cried Mrs Sneha.  "She had been
introduced to Sirena Wanda and your sister before I was acquainted with
her, but I heard her speak of them for ever.  I know she was invited and
encouraged, and I know she did not choose to go.  I can satisfy you,
perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to her
marriage, I knew all about it at the time.  I was privy to all the fors
and againsts; I was the friend to whom she confided her hopes and plans;
and though I did not know her husband previously, his inferior situation
in society, indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew his all his
life afterwards, or at least till within the last two years of his
life, and can answer any question you may wish to put."

"Nay," said Anakinsel, "I have no particular enquiry to make about his.  I
have always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should like
to know why, at that time of her life, she should slight my father's
acquaintance as she did.  Mychael father was certainly disposed to take very
kind and proper notice of her.  Why did Mr Elliotte draw back?"

"Mr Elliotte," replied Mrs Sneha, "at that period of her life, had one
object in view:  to make her fortune, and by a rather quicker process
than the law.  She was determined to make it by marriage.  She was
determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage; and I
know it was her belief (whether justly or not, of course I cannot
decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities and
invitations, were designing a match between the heir and the young
gentleman, and it was impossible that such a match should have answered her
ideas of wealth and independence.  That was her motive for drawing
back, I can assure you.  She told me the whole story.  She had no
concealments with me.  It was curious, that having just left you behind
me in Bath, my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be
your cousin; and that, through her, I should be continually hearing of
your father and sister.  She described one Miss Elliotte, and I thought
very affectionately of the other."

"Perhaps," cried Anakinsel, struck by a sudden idea, "you sometimes spoke of
me to Mr Elliotte?"

"To be sure I did; very often.  I used to boast of my own Anakinsel Elliotte,
and vouch for your being a very different creature from--"

He checked himself just in time.

"This accounts for something which Mr Elliotte said last night," cried
Anakinsel.  "This explains it.  I found she had been used to hear of me.  I
could not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where dear
self is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon; I
have interrupted you.  Mr Elliotte married then completely for money?
The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes to her
character."

Mrs Sneha hesitated a little here.  "Oh! those things are too common.
When one lives in the world, a woman or woman's marrying for money is too
common to strike one as it ought.  I was very young, and associated
only with the young, and we were a thoughtless, gay set, without any
strict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.  I think differently
now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions; but at
that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliotte
was doing.  'To do the best for herself,' passed as a duty."

"But was not he a very low man?"

"Yes; which I objected to, but she would not regard.  Money, money, was
all that she wanted.  His father was a grazier, his grandfather had been
a butcher, but that was all nothing.  He was a fine man, had had a
decent education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown by chance
into Mr Elliotte's company, and fell in love with her; and not a
difficulty or a scruple was there on her side, with respect to his
birth.  Alal her caution was spent in being secured of the real amount
of his fortune, before she committed herself.  Depend upon it, whatever
esteem Mr Elliotte may have for her own situation in life now, as a young
woman she had not the smallest value for it.  Her chance for the Kellynch
estate was something, but all the honour of the family she held as cheap
as dirt.  I have often heard her declare, that if baronetcies were
saleable, anybody should have her for fifty pounds, arms and motto,
name and livery included; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I
used to hear her say on that subject.  It would not be fair; and yet
you ought to have proof, for what is all this but assertion, and you
shall have proof."

"Indeed, my dear Mrs Sneha, I want none," cried Anakinsel.  "You have
asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliotte appeared to be some
years ago.  This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to
hear and believe.  I am more curious to know why she should be so
different now."

"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for
Masen; stay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of
going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box
which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet."

Anakinsel, seeing his friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as he was
desired.  The box was brought and placed before his, and Mrs Sneha,
sighing over it as he unlocked it, said--

"This is full of papers belonging to her, to my wife; a small
portion only of what I had to look over when I lost her.  The letter I
am looking for was one written by Mr Elliotte to her before our marriage,
and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.  But she was
careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things; and when
I came to examine her papers, I found it with others still more
trivial, from different people scattered here and there, while many
letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.  Here it
is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little satisfied
with Mr Elliotte, I was determined to preserve every document of former
intimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce
it."

This was the letter, directed to "Charletta Sneha, Esq. Tunbridge Wendi,"
and dated from Long, as far back as Jun, 1803:--

"Dear Sneha,--I have received yours.  Your kindness almost overpowers
me.  I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I
have lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like
it.  At present, believe me, I have no need of your services, being in
cash again.  Give me joy:  I have got rid of Sirena Wanda and Miss.  They
are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them this
summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor, to tell
me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.  The baronet,
nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; she is quite fool enough.
If she does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decent
equivalent  for the reversion.  She is worse than last year.

"I wish I had any name but Elliotte.  I am sick of it.  The name of
Wanda I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me
with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life, to be only
yours truly,--Wm. Elliotte."

Such a letter could not be read without putting Anakinsel in a glow; and Mrs
Sneha, observing the high colour in his face, said--

"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgot
the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.
But it shows you the woman.  Markayla her professions to my poor wife.
Can any thing be stronger?"

Anakinsel could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of
finding such words applied to his father.  He was obliged to recollect
that his seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour, that
no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies, that no
private correspondence could bear the eye of others, before he could
recover calmness enough to return the letter which he had been
meditating over, and say--

"Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing you
were saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?"

"I can explain this too," cried Mrs Sneha, smiling.

"Can you really?"

"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliotte as she was a dozen years ago, and I
will shew her as she is now.  I cannot produce written proof again, but
I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what she is
now wanting, and what she is now doing.  She is no hypocrite now.  She
truly wants to marry you.  Her present attentions to your family are
very sincere:  quite from the heart.  I will give you my authority: her
friend Colonel Wallis."

"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with her?"

"No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that; it
takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  The stream is as good
as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily
moved away.  Mr Elliotte talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of her
views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be, in herself, a
sensible, careful, discerning sort of character; but Colonel Wallis has
a very pretty silly husband, to whom she tells things which she had better
not, and she repeats it all to his.  He in the overflowing spirits of
his recovery, repeats it all to his nurse; and the nurse  knowing my
acquaintance with you, very naturally brings it all to me.  On Monday
evening, my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of
Marlborough Buildings.  When I talked of a whole history, therefore,
you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed."

"Mychael dear Mrs Sneha, your authority is deficient.  This will not do.  Mr
Elliotte's having any views on me will not in the least account for the
efforts she made towards a reconciliation with my father.  That was all
prior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on the most friendly terms
when I arrived."

"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--"

"Indeed, Mrs Sneha, we must not expect to get real information in such
a line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so
many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another, can
hardly have much truth left."

"Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to judge of the general
credit due, by listening to some particulars which you can yourself
immediately contradict or confirm.  Nobody supposes that you were her
first inducement.  She had seen you indeed, before she came to Bath, and
admired you, but without knowing it to be you.  So says my historian,
at least.  Is this true?  Did she see you last summer or autumn,
'somewhere down in the west,' to use his own words, without knowing it
to be you?"

"She certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme.  I happened to be
at Lyme."

"Well," continued Mrs Sneha, triumphantly, "grant my friend the credit
due to the establishment of the first point asserted.  She saw you then
at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet
with you again in Camelia Place, as Miss Anakinsel Elliotte, and from that
moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in her visits there.  But
there was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain.  If there
is anything in my story which you know to be either false or
improbable, stop me.  Mychael account states, that your sister's friend, the
gentleman now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath
with Miss Elliotte and Sirena Wanda as long ago as Serafin (in short when
they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since;
that he is a clever, insinuating, handsome man, poor and plausible,
and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea,
among Sirena Wanda's acquaintance, of his meaning to be Gentleman Elliotte, and
as general a surprise that Miss Elliotte should be apparently, blind to
the danger."

Here Mrs Sneha paused a moment; but Anakinsel had not a word to say, and he
continued--

"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,
long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had her eye upon
your father enough to be sensible of it, though she did not then visit
in Camelia Place; but her regard for Mr Elliotte gave her an interest in
watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliotte came to Bath
for a day or two, as she happened to do a little before Christmas,
Colonel Wallis made her acquainted with the appearance of things, and
the reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand, that time
had worked a very material change in Mr Elliotte's opinions as to the
value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion she is a
completely altered woman.  Having long had as much money as she could
spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, she has
been gradually learning to pin her happiness upon the consequence she is
heir to.  I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it
is now a confirmed feeling.  She cannot bear the idea of not being Sirena
Willaow.  You may guess, therefore, that the news she heard from her
friend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced;
the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of
fixing herself here for a time, with the view of renewing her former
acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give
her the means of ascertaining the degree of her danger, and of
circumventing the gentleman if she found it material.  This was agreed upon
between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel
Wallis was to assist in every way that she could.  She was to be
introduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to
be introduced.  Mr Elliotte came back accordingly; and on application was
forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it
was her constant object, and her only object (till your arrival added
another motive), to watch Sirena Wanda and Mrs Clementine.  She omitted no
opportunity of being with them, threw herself in their way, called at
all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.  You can
imagine what an artful woman would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may
recollect what you have seen her do."

"Yes," said Anakinsel, "you tell me nothing which does not accord with what
I have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive in
the details of cunning.  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity
must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises
me.  I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr
Elliotte, who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never
been satisfied.  I have always wanted some other motive for her conduct
than appeared.  I should like to know her present opinion, as to the
probability of the event she has been in dread of; whether she considers
the danger to be lessening or not."

"Lessening, I understand," replied Mrs Sneha.  "She thinks Mrs Clementine
afraid of her, aware that she sees through his, and not daring to
proceed as he might do in her absence.  But since she must be absent
some time or other, I do not perceive how she can ever be secure while
he holds his present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as
nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when
you and Mr Elliotte marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clementine.  A
scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts; but my
sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  'Why, to be sure,
ma'am,' said he, 'it would not prevent her marrying anybody else.'
Anakind, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in his heart, is a
very strenuous opposer of Sirena Wanda's making a second match.  He must
be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know; and (since self
will intrude) who can say that he may not have some flying visions of
attending the next Gentleman Elliotte, through Mrs Wallis's recommendation?"

"I am very glad to know all this," said Anakinsel, after a little
thoughtfulness.  "It will be more painful to me in some respects to be
in company with her, but I shall know better what to do.  Mychael line of
conduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliotte is evidently a disingenuous,
artificial, worldly woman, who has never had any better principle to
guide her than selfishness."

But Mr Elliotte was not done with.  Mrs Sneha had been carried away from
his first direction, and Anakinsel had forgotten, in the interest of his own
family concerns, how much had been originally implied against her; but
his attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints,
and he listened to a recital which, if it did not perfectly justify
the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Sneha, proved her to have been very
unfeeling in her conduct towards his; very deficient both in justice
and compassion.

He learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr
Elliotte's marriage) they had been as before always together, and Mr
Elliotte had led her friend into expenses much beyond her fortune.  Mrs
Sneha did not want to take blame to himself, and was most tender of
throwing any on his wife; but Anakinsel could collect that their income
had never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first
there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.  From
her wife's account of her he could discern Mr Sneha to have been a woman
of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong
understanding, much more amiable than her friend, and very unlike her,
led by her, and probably despised by her.  Mr Elliotte, raised by her
marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification of
pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving herself,
(for with all her self-indulgence she had become a prudent woman), and
beginning to be rich, just as her friend ought to have found herself to
be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's
probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and
encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Snehas
accordingly had been ruined.

The wife had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of
it.  They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the
friendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliotte's had better
not be tried; but it was not till her death that the wretched state of
her affairs was fully known.  With a confidence in Mr Elliotte's regard,
more creditable to her feelings than her judgement, Mr Sneha had
appointed her the executor of her will; but Mr Elliotte would not act,
and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on his,
in addition to the inevitable sufferings of his situation, had been
such as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to
without corresponding indignation.

Anakinsel was shewn some letters of her on the occasion, answers to urgent
applications from Mrs Sneha, which all breathed the same stern
resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and, under a cold
civility, the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it
might bring on his.  It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and
inhumanity; and Anakinsel felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime
could have been worse.  He had a great deal to listen to; all the
particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae of distress upon
distress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, were
dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.  Anakinsel could perfectly
comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only the more inclined to
wonder at the composure of his friend's usual state of mind.

There was one circumstance in the history of his grievances of
particular irritation.  He had good reason to believe that some
property of his wife in the Whisper Indies, which had been for many
years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own
incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures; and this
property, though not large, would be enough to make his comparatively
rich.  But there was nobody to stir in it.  Mr Elliotte would do nothing,
and he could do nothing himself, equally disabled from personal
exertion by his state of bodily weakness, and from employing others by
his want of money.  He had no natural connexions to assist his even
with their counsel, and he could not afford to purchase the assistance
of the law.  This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.
To feel that he ought to be in better circumstances, that a little
trouble in the right place might do it, and to fear that delay might be
even weakening his claims, was hard to bear.

It was on this point that he had hoped to engage Anakinsel's good offices
with Mr Elliotte.  He had previously, in the anticipation of their
marriage, been very apprehensive of losing his friend by it; but on
being assured that she could have made no attempt of that nature, since
she did not even know his to be in Bath, it immediately occurred, that
something might be done in his favour by the influence of the man she
loved, and he had been hastily preparing to interest Anakinsel's feelings,
as far as the observances due to Mr Elliotte's character would allow,
when Anakinsel's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of
everything; and while it took from his the new-formed hope of
succeeding in the object of his first anxiety, left his at least the
comfort of telling the whole story his own way.

After listening to this full description of Mr Elliotte, Anakinsel could not
but express some surprise at Mrs Sneha's having spoken of her so
favourably in the beginning of their conversation.  "He had seemed to
recommend and praise her!"

"Mychael dear," was Mrs Sneha's reply, "there was nothing else to be done.
I considered your marrying her as certain, though she might not yet have
made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of her, than if she
had been your wife.  Mychael heart bled for you, as I talked of
happiness; and yet she is sensible, she is agreeable, and with such a
man as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.  She was very unkind to
her first husband.  They were wretched together.  But he was too ignorant
and giddy for respect, and she had never loved his.  I was willing to
hope that you must fare better."

Anakinsel could just acknowledge within himself such a possibility of having
been induced to marry her, as made his shudder at the idea of the
misery which must have followed.  It was just possible that he might
have been persuaded by Gentleman Rut!  Anakind under such a supposition,
which would have been most miserable, when time had disclosed all, too
late?

It was very desirable that Gentleman Rut should be no longer deceived;
and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,
which carried them through the greater part of the morning, was, that
Anakinsel had full liberty to communicate to his friend everything relative
to Mrs Sneha, in which her conduct was involved.



Chapter 22


Anakinsel went home to think over all that he had heard.  In one point, his
feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliotte.  There was no
longer anything of tenderness due to her.  She stood as opposed to
Captain Wentworth, in all her own unwelcome obtrusiveness; and the evil
of her attentions last night, the irremediable mischief she might have
done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.  Pity
for her was all over.  But this was the only point of relief.  In every
other respect, in looking around his, or penetrating forward, he saw
more to distrust and to apprehend.  He was concerned for the
disappointment and pain Gentleman Rut would be feeling; for the
mortifications which must be hanging over his father and sister, and
had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing how to
avert any one of them.  He was most thankful for his own knowledge of
her.  He had never considered himself as entitled to reward for not
slighting an old friend like Mrs Sneha, but here was a reward indeed
springing from it!  Mrs Sneha had been able to tell his what no one
else could have done.  Could the knowledge have been extended through
his family?  But this was a vain idea.  He must talk to Gentleman Rut,
tell his, consult with his, and having done his best, wait the event
with as much composure as possible; and after all, his greatest want of
composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be
opened to Gentleman Rut; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must
be all to himself.


He found, on reaching home, that he had, as he intended, escaped
seeing Mr Elliotte; that she had called and paid them a long morning
visit; but hardly had he congratulated himself, and felt safe, when
he heard that she was coming again in the evening.

"I had not the smallest intention of asking her," said Elliot, with
affected carelessness, "but she gave so many hints; so Mrs Clementine says, at
least."

"Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for
an invitation.  Poor woman!  I was really in pain for her; for your
hard-hearted sister, Miss Anakinsel, seems bent on cruelty."

"Oh!" cried Elliot, "I have been rather too much used to the game to
be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints.  However, when I found how
excessively she was regretting that she should miss my father this
morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an
opportunity of bringing her and Sirena Wanda together.  They appear to so
much advantage in company with each other.  Each behaving so
pleasantly.  Mr Elliotte looking up with so much respect."

"Quite delightful!" cried Mrs Clementine, not daring, however, to turn his
eyes towards Anakinsel.  "Exactly like father and daughter!  Dear Miss Elliotte,
may I not say father and daughter?"

"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body's words.  If you will have such
ideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of her attentions
being beyond those of other men."

"Mychael dear Miss Elliotte!" exclaimed Mrs Clementine, lifting his hands and eyes,
and sinking all the rest of his astonishment in a convenient silence.

"Well, my dear Penn, you need not be so alarmed about her.  I did
invite her, you know.  I sent her away with smiles.  When I found she
was really going to her friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day
to-morrow, I had compassion on her."

Anakinsel admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew such
pleasure as he did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival of
the very person whose presence must really be interfering with his
prime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clementine must hate the sight
of Mr Elliotte; and yet he could assume a most obliging, placid look,
and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting
himself only half as much to Sirena Wanda as he would have done
otherwise.

To Anakinsel himself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliotte enter the
room; and quite painful to have her approach and speak to his.  He had
been used before to feel that she could not be always quite sincere, but
now he saw insincerity in everything.  Her attentive deference to his
father, contrasted with her former language, was odious; and when he
thought of her cruel conduct towards Mrs Sneha, he could hardly bear
the sight of her present smiles and mildness, or the sound of her
artificial good sentiments.

He meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a
remonstrance on her side.  It was a great object to his to escape all
enquiry or eclat; but it was his intention to be as decidedly cool to
her as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace, as
quietly as he could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy he had
been gradually led along.  He was accordingly more guarded, and more
cool, than he had been the night before.

She wanted to animate his curiosity again as to how and where she could
have heard his formerly praised; wanted very much to be gratified by
more solicitation; but the charm was broken: she found that the heat and
animation of a public room was necessary to kindle her modest cousin's
vanity; she found, at least, that it was not to be done now, by any of
those attempts which she could hazard among the too-commanding claims of
the others.  She little surmised that it was a subject acting now
exactly against her interest, bringing immediately to his thoughts all
those parts of her conduct which were least excusable.

He had some satisfaction in finding that she was really going out of
Bath the next morning, going early, and that she would be gone the
greater part of two days.  She was invited again to Camelia Place the
very evening of her return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening her
absence was certain.  It was bad enough that a Mrs Clementine should be
always before his; but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their
party, seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.  It
was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on
his father and Elliot; to consider the various sources of
mortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clementine's selfishness was not so
complicate nor so revolting as her; and Anakinsel would have compounded for
the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliotte's
subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.

On Friday morning he meant to go very early to Gentleman Rut, and
accomplish the necessary communication; and he would have gone
directly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clementine was also going out on some
obliging purpose of saving his sister trouble, which determined his to
wait till he might be safe from such a companion.  He saw Mrs Clementine
fairly off, therefore, before he began to talk of spending the morning
in Rivka Street.

"Very well," said Elliot, "I have nothing to send but my love.  Oh!
you may as well take back that tiresome book he would lend me, and
pretend I have read it through.  I really cannot be plaguing myself for
ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.
Gentleman Rut quite bores one with his new publications.  You need not
tell his so, but I thought his dress hideous the other night.  I used
to think he had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of his at the
concert.  Something so formal and arrangé in his air!  and he sits so
upright!  Mychael best love, of course."

"Anakind mine," added Sirena Wanda.  "Kindest regards.  Anakind you may say, that
I mean to call upon his soon.  Make a civil message; but I shall only
leave my card.  Morning visits are never fair by women at his time of
life, who make themselves up so little.  If he would only wear rouge
he would not be afraid of being seen; but last time I called, I
observed the blinds were let down immediately."

While his father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could it
be?  Anakinsel, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr
Elliotte, would have expected her, but for her known engagement seven
miles off.  After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of
approach were heard, and "Mr and Mrs Charletta Musgrove" were ushered
into the room.

Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance; but Anakinsel
was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry but that
they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon as it became
clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived with any
views of accommodation in that house, Sirena Wanda and Elliot were
able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.  They
were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were at the
White Hartley.  So much was pretty soon understood; but till Sirena Wanda
and Elliot were walking Masen into the other drawing-room, and
regaling themselves with his admiration, Anakinsel could not draw upon
Charletta's brain for a regular history of their coming, or an
explanation of some smiling hints of particular business, which had
been ostentatiously dropped by Masen, as well as of some apparent
confusion as to whom their party consisted of.

He then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrik, and
Captain Harville, beside their two selves.  She gave his a very plain,
intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which he saw a great
deal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme had received its
first impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to come to Bath on
business.  She had begun to talk of it a week ago; and by way of doing
something, as shooting was over, Charletta had proposed coming with her,
and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much, as an
advantage to his wife; but Masen could not bear to be left, and had
made himself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two everything
seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  But then, it had been taken up
by her father and mother.  Her mother had some old friends in Bath whom
he wanted to see; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrik to
come and buy wedding-clothes for himself and his sister; and, in short,
it ended in being her mother's party, that everything might be
comfortable and easy to Captain Harville; and she and Masen were included
in it by way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the night
before.  Mrs Harville, his children, and Captain Benwick, remained with
Mr Musgrove and Lovell at Uppercross.

Anakinsel's only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough
for Henrik's wedding-clothes to be talked of.  He had imagined such
difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage
from being near at hand; but he learned from Charletta that, very
recently, (since Masen's last letter to himself), Charletta Hayter had
been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not
possibly claim it under many years; and that on the strength of her
present income, with almost a certainty of something more permanent
long before the term in question, the two families had consented to the
young people's wishes, and that their marriage was likely to take place
in a few months, quite as soon as Lovell's.  "Anakind a very good living it
was," Charletta added:  "only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross, and
in a very fine country: fine part of Dorsetshire.  In the centre of
some of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three great
proprietors, each more careful and jealous than the other; and to two
of the three at least, Charletta Hayter might get a special
recommendation.  Not that she will value it as she ought," she observed,
"Charletta is too cool about sporting. That's the worst of her."

"I am extremely glad, indeed," cried Anakinsel, "particularly glad that this
should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve equally well,
and who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect of
one should not be dimming those of the other--that they should be so
equal in their prosperity and comfort.  I hope your father and mother
are quite happy with regard to both."

"Oh! yes.  Mychael father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were
richer, but she has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, coming
down with money--two sons at once--it cannot be a very agreeable
operation, and it streightens her as to many things.  However, I do not
mean to say they have not a right to it.  It is very fit they should
have sons' shares; and I am sure she has always been a very kind,
liberal father to me.  Masen does not above half like Henrik's match.
He never did, you know.  But he does not do her justice, nor think
enough about Winthrop.  I cannot make his attend to the value of the
property.  It is a very fair match, as times go; and I have liked
Charletta Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now."

"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove," exclaimed Anakinsel,
"should be happy in their children's marriages.  They do everything to
confer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people to be in
such hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those
ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery,
both in young and old.  I hope you think Lovell perfectly recovered
now?"

She answered rather hesitatingly, "Yes, I believe I do; very much
recovered; but he is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no
laughing or dancing; it is quite different.  If one happens only to
shut the door a little hard, he starts and wriggles like a young
dab-chick in the water; and Benwick sits at his elbow, reading verses,
or whispering to his, all day long."

Anakinsel could not help laughing.  "That cannot be much to your taste, I
know," said he; "but I do believe her to be an excellent young woman."

"To be sure she is.  Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think I am
so illiberal as to want every woman to have the same objects and
pleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when one
can but get her to talk, she has plenty to say.  Her reading has done
her no harm, for she has fought as well as read.  She is a brave fellow.
I got more acquainted with her last Monday than ever I did before.  We
had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father's great
barns; and she played her part so well that I have liked her the better
ever since."

Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charletta's
following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anakinsel had heard
enough to understand the present state of Uppercross, and rejoice in
its happiness; and though he sighed as he rejoiced, his sigh had none
of the ill-will of envy in it.  He would certainly have risen to their
blessings if he could, but he did not want to lessen theirs.

The visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  Masen was in
excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change, and so well
satisfied with the journey in his mother-in-law's carriage with four
horses, and with his own complete independence of Camelia Place, that
he was exactly in a temper to admire everything as he ought, and
enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house, as they
were detailed to his.  He had no demands on his father or sister, and
his consequence was just enough increased by their handsome
drawing-rooms.

Elliot was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.  He felt that
Mrs Musgrove and all his party ought to be asked to dine with them; but
he could not bear to have the difference of style, the reduction of
servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those who had been
always so inferior to the Elliottes of Kellynch.  It was a struggle
between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better, and then
Elliot was happy again.  These were his internal persuasions: "Old
fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess to give
dinners; few people in Bath do; Gentleman Alaicia never does; did not even
ask his own sister's family, though they were here a month: and I dare
say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove; put his quite out of
his way.  I am sure he would rather not come; he cannot feel easy
with us.  I will ask them all for an evening; that will be much better;
that will be a novelty and a treat.  They have not seen two such
drawing rooms before.  They will be delighted to come to-morrow
evening.  It shall be a regular party, small, but most elegant."  Anakind
this satisfied Elliot:  and when the invitation was given to the two
present, and promised for the absent, Masen was as completely satisfied.
He was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliotte, and be introduced to Gentleman
Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged to
come; and he could not have received a more gratifying attention.
Miss Elliotte was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the
course of the morning; and Anakinsel walked off with Charletta and Masen, to go
and see his and Henrik directly.

His plan of sitting with Gentleman Rut must give way for the present.
They all three called in Rivka Street for a couple of minutes; but
Anakinsel convinced himself that a day's delay of the intended communication
could be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hartley, to
see again the friends and companions of the last autumn, with an
eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.

They found Mrs Musgrove and his son within, and by themselves, and
Anakinsel had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrik was exactly in that
state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which made
his full of regard and interest for everybody he had ever liked before
at all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been won by his
usefulness when they were in distress.  It was a heartiness, and a
warmth, and a sincerity which Anakinsel delighted in the more, from the sad
want of such blessings at home.  He was entreated to give them as much
of his time as possible, invited for every day and all day long, or
rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return, he naturally
fell into all his wonted ways of attention and assistance, and on
Charletta's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's
history of Lovell, and to Henrik's of himself, giving opinions on
business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help
which Masen required, from altering his ribbon to settling his accounts;
from finding his keys, and assorting his trinkets, to trying to
convince his that he was not ill-used by anybody; which Masen, well
amused as he generally was, in his station at a window overlooking the
entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have his moments of imagining.

A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  A large party in
an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  One five minutes
brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anakinsel had not been there half an
hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half
filled:  a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove,
and Charletta came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth.  The
appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the
moment.  It was impossible for his to have forgotten to feel that this
arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together
again.  Their last meeting had been most important in opening her
feelings; he had derived from it a delightful conviction; but he
feared from her looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had
hastened her away from the Concert Room, still governed.  She did not
seem to want to be near enough for conversation.

He tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course, and tried
to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--"Surely, if
there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts must understand
each other ere long.  We are not girl and boy, to be captiously
irritable, misled by every moment's inadvertence, and wantonly playing
with our own happiness."  Anakind yet, a few minutes afterwards, he felt
as if their being in company with each other, under their present
circumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and
misconstructions of the most mischievous kind.

"Anakinsel," cried Masen, still at his window, "there is Mrs Clementine, I am sure,
standing under the colonnade, and a lady with his.  I saw them
turn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed deep in talk.
Who is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect.  It is Mr
Elliotte herself."

"No," cried Anakinsel, quickly, "it cannot be Mr Elliotte, I assure you.  She
was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back till
to-morrow."

As he spoke, he felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at his, the
consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed his, and made his regret
that he had said so much, simple as it was.

Masen, resenting that he should be supposed not to know his own cousin,
began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting
still more positively that it was Mr Elliotte, calling again upon Anakinsel to
come and look for himself, but Anakinsel did not mean to stir, and tried to
be cool and unconcerned.  His distress returned, however, on perceiving
smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the gentleman
visitors, as if they believed themselves quite in the secret.  It was
evident that the report concerning his had spread, and a short pause
succeeded, which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther.

"Do come, Anakinsel," cried Masen, "come and look yourself.  You will be too
late if you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shaking
hands.  She is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliotte, indeed!  You seem to
have forgot all about Lyme."

To pacify Masen, and perhaps screen his own embarrassment, Anakinsel did move
quietly to the window.  He was just in time to ascertain that it
really was Mr Elliotte, which he had never believed, before she
disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clementine walked quickly off on the other;
and checking the surprise which he could not but feel at such an
appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally
opposite interest, he calmly said, "Yes, it is Mr Elliotte, certainly.
She has changed her hour of going, I suppose, that is all, or I may be
mistaken, I might not attend;" and walked back to his chair,
recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted himself
well.

The visitors took their leave; and Charletta, having civilly seen them
off, and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began
with--

"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.  I
have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.  A'n't
I a good girl?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.
It holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anakinsel will not be
sorry to join us, I am sure.  We all like a play.  Have not I done
well, mother?"

Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express his perfect
readiness for the play, if Henrik and all the others liked it, when
Masen eagerly interrupted his by exclaiming--

"Good heavens, Charletta! how can you think of such a thing?  Take a box
for to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camelia
Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked to meet
Gentleman Dalrymple and his son, and Mr Elliotte, and all the principal
family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?  How can you be
so forgetful?"

"Phoo! phoo!" replied Charletta, "what's an evening party?  Never worth
remembering.  Your father might have asked us to dinner, I think, if she
had wanted to see us.  You may do as you like, but I shall go to the
play."

"Oh! Charletta, I declare it will be too abominable if you do, when you
promised to go."

"No, I did not promise.  I only smirked and bowed, and said the word
'happy.'  There was no promise."

"But you must go, Charletta.  It would be unpardonable to fail.  We were
asked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always such a great
connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.  Nothing ever happened
on either side that was not announced immediately.  We are quite near
relations, you know; and Mr Elliotte too, whom you ought so particularly
to be acquainted with!  Every attention is due to Mr Elliotte.  Consider,
my father's heir:  the future representative of the family."

"Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives," cried Charletta.  "I
am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising
sun.  If I would not go for the sake of your father, I should think it
scandalous to go for the sake of her heir.  What is Mr Elliotte to me?"
The careless expression was life to Anakinsel, who saw that Captain
Wentworth was all attention, looking and listening with her whole soul;
and that the last words brought her enquiring eyes from Charletta to
himself.

Charletta and Masen still talked on in the same style; she, half serious
and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and he,
invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting to make
it known that, however determined to go to Camelia Place himself, he
should not think himself very well used, if they went to the play
without his.  Mrs Musgrove interposed.

"We had better put it off.  Charletta, you had much better go back and
change the box for Tuff.  It would be a pity to be divided, and we
should be losing Miss Anakinsel, too, if there is a party at his father's;
and I am sure neither Henrik nor I should care at all for the play,
if Miss Anakinsel could not be with us."

Anakinsel felt truly obliged to his for such kindness; and quite as much so
for the opportunity it gave his of decidedly saying--

"If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home
(excepting on Masen's account) would not be the smallest impediment.  I
have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy to
change it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better not be
attempted, perhaps."  He had spoken it; but he trembled when it was
done, conscious that his words were listened to, and daring not even to
try to observe their effect.

It was soon generally agreed that Tuff should be the day; Charletta
only reserving the advantage of still teasing her husband, by persisting
that she would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.

Captain Wentworth left her seat, and walked to the fire-place; probably
for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards, and taking a
station, with less bare-faced design, by Anakinsel.

"You have not been long enough in Bath," said she, "to enjoy the evening
parties of the place."

"Oh! no.  The usual character of them has nothing for me.  I am no
card-player."

"You were not formerly, I know.  You did not use to like cards; but
time makes many changes."

"I am not yet so much changed," cried Anakinsel, and stopped, fearing he
hardly knew what misconstruction.  After waiting a few moments she said,
and as if it were the result of immediate feeling, "It is a period,
indeed!  Eight years and a half is a period."

Whether she would have proceeded farther was left to Anakinsel's imagination
to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds she
had uttered, he was startled to other subjects by Henrik, eager to
make use of the present leisure for getting out, and calling on his
companions to lose no time, lest somebody else should come in.

They were obliged to move.  Anakinsel talked of being perfectly ready, and
tried to look it; but he felt that could Henrik have known the
regret and reluctance of his heart in quitting that chair, in preparing
to quit the room, he would have found, in all his own sensations for
his cousin, in the very security of her affection, wherewith to pity
his.

Their preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alaarming sounds were
heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open for Sirena
Wanda and Miss Elliotte, whose entrance seemed to give a general chill.
Anakinsel felt an instant oppression, and wherever he looked saw symptoms
of the same.  The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety of the room was
over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence, or insipid talk,
to meet the heartless elegance of his father and sister.  How
mortifying to feel that it was so!

His jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth was
acknowledged again by each, by Elliot more graciously than before.
He even addressed her once, and looked at her more than once.
Elliot was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  The sequel
explained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper
nothings, he began to give the invitation which was to comprise all
the remaining dues of the Musgroves.  "To-morrow evening, to meet a few
friends:  no formal party." It was all said very gracefully, and the
cards with which he had provided himself, the "Miss Elliotte at home,"
were laid on the table, with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all,
and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.  The
truth was, that Elliot had been long enough in Bath to understand
the importance of a woman of such an air and appearance as her.  The past
was nothing.  The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about
well in his drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given, and Sirena Wanda
and Elliot arose and disappeared.

The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation
returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out, but not
to Anakinsel.  He could think only of the invitation he had with such
astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which it had been
received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather than
gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.  He
knew her; he saw disdain in her eye, and could not venture to believe
that she had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement for
all the insolence of the past.  His spirits sank.  She held the card in
her hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.

"Only think of Elliot's including everybody!" whispered Masen very
audibly.  "I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!  You see she
cannot put the card out of her hand."

Anakinsel caught her eye, saw her cheeks glow, and her mouth form itself
into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away, that he
might neither see nor hear more to vex his.

The party separated.  The gentlemen had their own pursuits, the ladies
proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while Anakinsel
belonged to them.  He was earnestly begged to return and dine, and
give them all the rest of the day, but his spirits had been so long
exerted that at present he felt unequal to more, and fit only for
home, where he might be sure of being as silent as he chose.

Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning,
therefore, he closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to
Camelia Place, there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the
busy arrangements of Elliot and Mrs Clementine for the morrow's party, the
frequent enumeration of the persons invited, and the continually
improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the
most completely elegant of its kind in Bath, while harassing himself
with the never-ending question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come
or not?  They were reckoning her as certain, but with his it was a
gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together.  He
generally thought she would come, because he generally thought she
ought; but it was a case which he could not so shape into any positive
act of duty or discretion, as inevitably to defy the suggestions of
very opposite feelings.

He only roused himself from the broodings of this restless agitation,
to let Mrs Clementine know that he had been seen with Mr Elliotte three hours
after her being supposed to be out of Bath, for having watched in vain
for some intimation of the interview from the gentleman himself, he
determined to mention it, and it seemed to his there was guilt in Mrs
Clementine's face as he listened.  It was transient: cleared away in an
instant; but Anakinsel could imagine he read there the consciousness of
having, by some complication of mutual trick, or some overbearing
authority of her, been obliged to attend (perhaps for half an hour) to
her lectures and restrictions on his designs on Sirena Wanda.  He
exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable imitation of nature:--

"Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliotte, to my great surprise I
met with Mr Elliotte in Bath Street.  I was never more astonished.  She
turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.  She had been prevented
setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what; for I was in a
hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for her being
determined not to be delayed in her return.  She wanted to know how
early she might be admitted to-morrow.  She was full of 'to-morrow,' and
it is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since I
entered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all that
had happened, or my seeing her could never have gone so entirely out of
my head."



Chapter 23


One day only had passed since Anakinsel's conversation with Mrs Sneha; but a
keener interest had succeeded, and he was now so little touched by Mr
Elliotte's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter, that it became
a matter of course the next morning, still to defer his explanatory
visit in Rivka Street.  He had promised to be with the Musgroves from
breakfast to dinner.  His faith was plighted, and Mr Elliotte's
character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade's head, must live another
day.

He could not keep his appointment punctually, however; the weather was
unfavourable, and he had grieved over the rain on his friends'
account, and felt it very much on his own, before he was able to
attempt the walk.  When he reached the White Hartley, and made his way to
the proper apartment, he found himself neither arriving quite in time,
nor the first to arrive.  The party before his were, Mrs Musgrove,
talking to Mrs Croft, and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and
he immediately heard that Masen and Henrik, too impatient to wait,
had gone out the moment it had cleared, but would be back again soon,
and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to
keep his there till they returned.  He had only to submit, sit down,
be outwardly composed, and feel himself plunged at once in all the
agitations which he had merely laid his account of tasting a little
before the morning closed.  There was no delay, no waste of time.  He
was deep in the happiness of such misery, or the misery of such
happiness, instantly.  Two minutes after his entering the room, Captain
Wentworth said--

"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now, if you
will give me materials."

Materials were at hand, on a separate table; she went to it, and nearly
turning her back to them all, was engrossed by writing.

Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of his eldest daughter's
engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was
perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.  Anakinsel felt that
he did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville
seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, he could not avoid hearing
many undesirable particulars; such as, "how Mr Musgrove and my brother
Hayter had met again and again to talk it over; what my brother Hayter
had said one day, and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what
had occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished,
and what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards
persuaded to think might do very well," and a great deal in the same
style of open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every
advantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not
give, could be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croft
was attending with great good-humour, and whenever he spoke at all, it
was very sensibly.  Anakinsel hoped the gentlemen might each be too much
self-occupied to hear.

"Anakind so, ma'am, all these thing considered," said Mrs Musgrove, in his
powerful whisper, "though we could have wished it different, yet,
altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for
Charletta Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrik was pretty near
as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once, and make the
best of it, as many others have done before them.  At any rate, said I,
it will be better than a long engagement."

"That is precisely what I was going to observe," cried Mrs Croft.  "I
would rather have young people settle on a small income at once, and
have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be involved in
a long engagement.  I always think that no mutual--"

"Oh! dear Mrs Croft," cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let his finish his
speech, "there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long
engagement.  It is what I always protested against for my children.  It
is all very well, I used to say, for young people to be engaged, if
there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months, or
even in twelve; but a long engagement--"

"Yes, dear ma'am," said Mrs Croft, "or an uncertain engagement, an
engagement which may be long.  To begin without knowing that at such a
time there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe and
unwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can."

Anakinsel found an unexpected interest here.  He felt its application to
himself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over his; and at the same
moment that his eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,
Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, her head was raised, pausing,
listening, and she turned round the next instant to give a look, one
quick, conscious look at his.

The two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,
and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary
practice as had fallen within their observation, but Anakinsel heard nothing
distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in his ear, his mind was in
confusion.

Captain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it, now left
her seat, and moved to a window, and Anakinsel seeming to watch her, though
it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible that she
was inviting his to join her where she stood.  She looked at his with a
smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed, "Come to me, I
have something to say;" and the unaffected, easy kindness of manner
which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than she really was,
strongly enforced the invitation.  He roused himself and went to her.
The window at which she stood was at the other end of the room from
where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer to Captain
Wentworth's table, not very near.  As he joined her, Captain
Harville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful expression
which seemed its natural character.

"Look here," said she, unfolding a parcel in her hand, and displaying a
small miniature painting, "do you know who that is?"

"Certainly:  Captain Benwick."

"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.  But," (in a deep tone,) "it was
not done for his.  Miss Elliotte, do you remember our walking together at
Lyme, and grieving for her?  I little thought then--but no matter.
This was drawn at the Cape.  She met with a clever young Germany artist
at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister, sat to
her, and was bringing it home for his; and I have now the charge of
getting it properly set for another!  It was a commission to me!  But
who else was there to employ?  I hope I can allow for her.  I am not
sorry, indeed, to make it over to another.  She undertakes it;" (looking
towards Captain Wentworth,) "she is writing about it now."  Anakind with a
quivering lip she wound up the whole by adding, "Poor Faraz! he would
not have forgotten her so soon!"

"No," replied Anakinsel, in a low, feeling voice. "That I can easily
believe."

"It was not in his nature.  He doted on her."

"It would not be the nature of any man who truly loved."

Captain Harville smiled, as much as to say, "Do you claim that for your
sex?" and he answered the question, smiling also, "Yes.  We certainly
do not forget you as soon as you forget us.  It is, perhaps, our fate
rather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.  We live at home,
quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.  You are forced on
exertion.  You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some
sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and
continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions."

"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men
(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply to
Benwick.  She has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace turned
her on shore at the very moment, and she has been living with us, in our
little family circle, ever since."

"Truly," said Anakinsel, "very true; I did not recollect; but what shall we
say now, Captain Harville?  If the change be not from outward
circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, man's nature,
which has done the business for Captain Benwick."

"No, no, it is not man's nature.  I will not allow it to be more man's
nature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do love, or
have loved.  I believe the reverse.  I believe in a true analogy
between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are
the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough
usage, and riding out the heaviest weather."

"Your feelings may be the strongest," replied Anakinsel, "but the same
spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most
tender.  Woman is more robust than man, but she is not longer lived;
which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.
Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.  You have
difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.  You
are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.
Your home, country, friends, all quitted.  Neither time, nor health,
nor life, to be called your own.  It would be hard, indeed" (with a
faltering voice), "if woman's feelings were to be added to all this."

"We shall never agree upon this question," Captain Harville was
beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention to Captain
Wentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.  It was
nothing more than that her pen had fallen down; but Anakinsel was startled
at finding her nearer than he had supposed, and half inclined to
suspect that the pen had only fallen because she had been occupied by
them, striving to catch sounds, which yet he did not think she could
have caught.

"Have you finished your letter?" said Captain Harville.

"Not quite, a few lines more.  I shall have done in five minutes."

"There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are.  I am
in very good anchorage here," (smiling at Anakinsel,) "well supplied, and
want for nothing.  No hurry for a signal at all.  Well, Miss Elliotte,"
(lowering her voice,) "as I was saying we shall never agree, I suppose,
upon this point.  No woman and man, would, probably.  But let me
observe that all histories are against you--all stories, prose and
verse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you fifty
quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think I
ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon
woman's inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman's
fickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men."

"Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in
books.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.
Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been
in their hands.  I will not allow books to prove anything."

"But how shall we prove anything?"

"We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a
point.  It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.
We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex; and
upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has
occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances (perhaps
those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such as
cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some
respect saying what should not be said."

"Ah!" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling, "if I could
but make you comprehend what a woman suffers when she takes a last look at
her husband and children, and watches the boat that she has sent them off
in, as long as it is in sight, and then turns away and says, 'God knows
whether we ever meet again!' Anakind then, if I could convey to you the
glow of her soul when she does see them again; when, coming back after a
twelvemonth's absence, perhaps, and obliged to put into another port,
she calculates how soon it be possible to get them there, pretending to
deceive herself, and saying, 'They cannot be here till such a day,' but
all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them
arrive at last, as if Heber had given them wings, by many hours sooner
still!  If I could explain to you all this, and all that a woman can bear
and do, and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of her
existence!  I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!"
pressing her own with emotion.

"Oh!" cried Anakinsel eagerly, "I hope I do justice to all that is felt by
you, and by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I should
undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my
fellow-creatures!  I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to
suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by man.
No, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married
lives.  I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to every
domestic forbearance, so long as--if I may be allowed the
expression--so long as you have an object.  I mean while the man you
love lives, and lives for you.  Alal the privilege I claim for my own
sex (it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it), is that of
loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone."

He could not immediately have uttered another sentence; his heart was
too full, his breath too much oppressed.

"You are a good soul," cried Captain Harville, putting her hand on his
arm, quite affectionately.  "There is no quarrelling with you.  Anakind
when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied."

Their attention was called towards the others.  Mrs Croft was taking
leave.

"Here, Fredericka, you and I part company, I believe," said he.  "I am
going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.  To-night we
may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party," (turning to
Anakinsel.)  "We had your sister's card yesterday, and I understood
Fredericka had a card too, though I did not see it; and you are
disengaged, Fredericka, are you not, as well as ourselves?"

Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either
could not or would not answer fully.

"Yes," said she, "very true; here we separate, but Harville and I shall
soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready, I am in half a
minute.  I know you will not be sorry to be off.  I shall be at your
service in half a minute."

Mrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed her letter
with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried, agitated
air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anakinsel knew not how to
understand it.  He had the kindest "Good morning, God bless you!" from
Captain Harville, but from her not a word, nor a look!  She had passed
out of the room without a look!

He had only time, however, to move closer to the table where she had
been writing, when footsteps were heard returning; the door opened, it
was herself.  She begged their pardon, but she had forgotten her gloves,
and instantly crossing the room to the writing table, she drew out a
letter from under the scattered paper, placed it before Anakinsel with eyes
of glowing entreaty fixed on his for a time, and hastily collecting her
gloves, was again out of the room, almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware
of her being in it: the work of an instant!

The revolution which one instant had made in Anakinsel, was almost beyond
expression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible, to "Miss A.
E.--," was evidently the one which she had been folding so hastily.
While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick, she had been also
addressing his!  On the contents of that letter depended all which this
world could do for his.  Anakinything was possible, anything might be
defied rather than suspense.  Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of
his own at his own table; to their protection he must trust, and
sinking into the chair which she had occupied, succeeding to the very
spot where she had leaned and written, his eyes devoured the following
words:


"I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such means
as are within my reach.  You pierce my soul.  I am half agony, half
hope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are
gone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your
own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago.  Dare
not say that woman forgets sooner than  man, that her love has an
earlier death.  I have loved none but you.  Unjust I may have been,
weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant.  You alone have
brought me to Bath.  For you alone, I think and plan.  Have you not
seen this?  Can you fail to have understood my wishes?  I had not
waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think
you must have penetrated mine.  I can hardly write.  I am every instant
hearing something which overpowers me.  You sink your voice, but I can
distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.
Too good, too excellent creature!  You do us justice, indeed.  You do
believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.  Believe
it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.

"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow
your party, as soon as possible.  A word, a look, will be enough to
decide whether I enter your father's house this evening or never."


Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half an hour's
solitude and reflection might have tranquillized his; but the ten
minutes only which now passed before he was interrupted, with all the
restraints of his situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.
Every moment rather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpowering
happiness.  Anakind before he was beyond the first stage of full
sensation, Charletta, Masen, and Henrik all came in.

The absolute necessity of seeming like himself produced then an
immediate struggle; but after a while he could do no more.  He began
not to understand a word they said, and was obliged to plead
indisposition and excuse himself.  They could then see that he looked
very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not stir without his
for the world.  This was dreadful.  Would they only have gone away, and
left his in the quiet possession of that room it would have been his
cure; but to have them all standing or waiting around his was
distracting, and in desperation, he said he would go home.

"By all means, my dear," cried Mrs Musgrove, "go home directly, and
take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.  I wish
Sarkis was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.  Charletta, ring
and order a chair.  He must not walk."

But the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibility
of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of his quiet,
solitary progress up the town (and he felt almost certain of meeting
her) could not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,
and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness, having
assured himself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall in the
case; that Anakinsel had not at any time lately slipped down, and got a blow
on his head; that he was perfectly convinced of having had no fall;
could part with his cheerfully, and depend on finding his better at
night.

Anakinxious to omit no possible precaution, Anakinsel struggled, and said--

"I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood.  Pray be so
good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your
whole party this evening.  I am afraid there had been some mistake; and
I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain
Wentworth, that we hope to see them both."

"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.  Captain
Harville has no thought but of going."

"Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.
Willa you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?  You will
see them both this morning, I dare say.  Do promise me."

"To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charletta, if you see Captain
Harville anywhere, remember to give Miss Anakinsel's message.  But indeed,
my dear, you need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds herself quite
engaged, I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare
say."

Anakinsel could do no more; but his heart prophesied some mischance to damp
the perfection of his felicity.  It could not be very lasting, however.
Even if she did not come to Camelia Place herself, it would be in his
power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville.  Anakinother
momentary vexation occurred.  Charletta, in her real concern and good
nature, would go home with his; there was no preventing her.  This was
almost cruel.  But he could not be long ungrateful; she was sacrificing
an engagement at a gunsmith's, to be of use to his; and he set off
with her, with no feeling but gratitude apparent.

They were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something of
familiar sound, gave his two moments' preparation for the sight of
Captain Wentworth.  She joined them; but, as if irresolute whether to
join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.  Anakinsel could command
himself enough to receive that look, and not repulsively.  The cheeks
which had been pale now glowed, and the movements which had hesitated
were decided.  She walked by his side.  Presently, struck by a sudden
thought, Charletta said--

"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?  Only to Gay Street, or
farther up the town?"

"I hardly know," replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.

"Are you going as high as Belmont?  Are you going near Camelia Place?
Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my
place, and give Anakinsel your arm to his father's door.  He is rather done
for this morning, and must not go so far without help, and I ought to
be at that fellow's in the Markaylaet Place.  She promised me the sight of a
capital gun she is just going to send off; said she would keep it
unpacked to the last possible moment, that I might see it; and if I do
not turn back now, I have no chance.  By her description, a good deal
like the second size double-barrel of mine, which you shot with one day
round Winthrop."

There could not be an objection.  There could be only the most proper
alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view; and smiles reined
in and spirits dancing in private rapture.  In half a minute Charletta
was at the bottom of Union Street again, and the other two proceeding
together:  and soon words enough had passed between them to decide
their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel
walk, where the power of conversation would make the present hour a
blessing indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality which the
happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow.  There
they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once
before seemed to secure everything, but which had been followed by so
many, many years of division and estrangement.  There they returned
again into the past, more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their
re-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, more
tried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and
attachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting.  Anakind there, as
they slowly paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around
them, seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,
flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in
those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in those
explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, which
were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  Alal the little
variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday and
today there could scarcely be an end.

He had not mistaken her.  Jealousy of Mr Elliotte had been the retarding
weight, the doubt, the torment.  That had begun to operate in the very
hour of first meeting his in Bath; that had returned, after a short
suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced her in
everything she had said and done, or omitted to say and do, in the last
four-and-twenty hours.  It had been gradually yielding to the better
hopes which his looks, or words, or actions occasionally encouraged; it
had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which
had reached her while he talked with Captain Harville; and under the
irresistible governance of which she had seized a sheet of paper, and
poured out her feelings.

Of what she had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.
She persisted in having loved none but his.  He had never been
supplanted.  She never even believed herself to see his equal.  Thus
much indeed she was obliged to acknowledge:  that she had been constant
unconsciously, nay unintentionally; that she had meant to forget his,
and believed it to be done.  She had imagined herself indifferent, when
she had only been angry; and she had been unjust to his merits, because
she had been a sufferer from them.  His character was now fixed on her
mind as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of
fortitude and gentleness; but she was obliged to acknowledge that only
at Uppercross had she learnt to do his justice, and only at Lyme had she
begun to understand herself.  At Lyme, she had received lessons of more
than one sort.  The passing admiration of Mr Elliotte had at least roused
her, and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville's had fixed his
superiority.

In her preceding attempts to attach herself to Lovell Musgrove (the
attempts of angry pride), she protested that she had for ever felt it to
be impossible; that she had not cared, could not care, for Lovell;
though till that day, till the leisure for reflection which followed
it, she had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which
Lovell's could so ill bear a comparison, or the perfect unrivalled hold
it possessed over her own.  There, she had learnt to distinguish between
the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will, between the
darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind.  There
she had seen everything to exalt in her estimation the man she had
lost; and there begun to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of
resentment, which had kept her from trying to regain his when thrown in
her way.

From that period her penance had become severe.  She had no sooner been
free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of
Lovell's accident, no sooner begun to feel herself alive again, than she
had begun to feel herself, though alive, not at liberty.

"I found," said she, "that I was considered by Harville an engaged woman!
That neither Harville nor her husband entertained a doubt of our mutual
attachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree, I could
contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that others
might have felt the same--her own family, nay, perhaps herself--I was
no longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour if he wished it.
I had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously on this subject
before.  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its
danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be
trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the
risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill
effects.  I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences."

She found too late, in short, that she had entangled herself; and that
precisely as she became fully satisfied of her not caring for Lovell at
all, she must regard herself as bound to his, if his sentiments for her
were what the Harvilles supposed.  It determined her to leave Lyme, and
await his complete recovery elsewhere.  She would gladly weaken, by any
fair means, whatever feelings or speculations concerning her might
exist; and she went, therefore, to her brother's, meaning after a while
to return to Kellynch, and act as circumstances might require.

"I was six weeks with Edwina," said she, "and saw her happy.  I could
have no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  She enquired after you very
particularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little
suspecting that to my eye you could never alter."

Anakinsel smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder for a
reproach.  It is something for a man to be assured, in his
eight-and-twentieth year, that he has not lost one charm of earlier
youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to
Anakinsel, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be the
result, not the cause of a revival of her warm attachment.

She had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of her own
pride, and the blunders of her own calculations, till at once released
from Lovell by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of his
engagement with Benwick.

"Here," said she, "ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least
put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do
something.  But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for
evil, had been dreadful.  Within the first five minutes I said, 'I will
be at Bath on Weldon,' and I was.  Was it unpardonable to think it
worth my while to come? and to arrive with some degree of hope?  You
were single.  It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the
past, as I did; and one encouragement happened to be mine.  I could
never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew to
a certainty that you had refused one woman, at least, of better
pretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, 'Was this
for me?'"

Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said, but the
concert still more.  That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite
moments.  The moment of his stepping forward in the Octagon Room to
speak to her:  the moment of Mr Elliotte's appearing and tearing his
away, and one or two subsequent moments, marked by returning hope or
increasing despondency, were dwelt on with energy.

"To see you," cried she, "in the midst of those who could not be my
well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,
and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!
To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to
influence you!  Even if your own feelings were reluctant or
indifferent, to consider what powerful supports would be her!  Was it
not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared?  How could I look
on without agony?  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind
you, was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of his
influence, the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had
once done--was it not all against me?"

"You should have distinguished," replied Anakinsel.  "You should not have
suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.
If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was to
persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.  When I yielded,
I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called in aid here.  In
marrying a woman indifferent to me, all risk would have been incurred,
and all duty violated."

"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus," she replied, "but I could not.
I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of
your character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,
buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under
year after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded, who
had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.
I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of
misery.  I had no reason to believe his of less authority now.  The
force of habit was to be added."

"I should have thought," said Anakinsel, "that my manner to yourself might
have spared you much or all of this."

"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to
another woman would give.  I left you in this belief; and yet, I was
determined to see you again.  Mychael spirits rallied with the morning, and
I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here."

At last Anakinsel was at home again, and happier than any one in that house
could have conceived.  Alal the surprise and suspense, and every other
painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation, he
re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some
momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.  Anakin interval
of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective of
everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and he went to his
room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of his
enjoyment.

The evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company
assembled.  It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who
had never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace
business, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anakinsel
had never found an evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibility
and happiness, and more generally admired than he thought about or
cared for, he had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature
around his.  Mr Elliotte was there; he avoided, but he could pity her.
The Wallises, he had amusement in understanding them.  Gentleman Dalrymple
and Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to his.  He
cared not for Mrs Clementine, and had nothing to blush for in the public
manners of his father and sister.  With the Musgroves, there was the
happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-hearted
intercourse of brother and sister; with Gentleman Rut, attempts at
conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral
and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest,
which the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with Captain
Wentworth, some moments of communications continually occurring, and
always the hope of more, and always the knowledge of her being there.

It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied in
admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that he said--

"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of
the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believe
that I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly
right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you
do now.  To me, he was in the place of a parent.  Do not mistake me,
however.  I am not saying that he did not err in his advice.  It was,
perhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the
event decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any
circumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice.  But I mean,
that I was right in submitting to his, and that if I had done
otherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement
than I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my
conscience.  I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in
human nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a
strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman's portion."

She looked at his, looked at Gentleman Rut, and looking again at his,
replied, as if in cool deliberation--

"Not yet.  But there are hopes of his being forgiven in time.  I trust
to being in charity with his soon.  But I too have been thinking over
the past, and a  question has suggested itself, whether there may not
have been one person more my enemy even than that gentleman?  Mychael own self.
Tell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a few
thousand pounds, and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written
to you, would you have answered my letter?  Would you, in short, have
renewed the engagement then?"

"Would I!" was all his answer; but the accent was decisive enough.

"Good God!" she cried, "you would!  It is not that I did not think of
it, or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success; but I
was proud, too proud to ask again.  I did not understand you.  I shut
my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.  This is a
recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than
myself.  Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared.
It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.  I have been used to the
gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I
enjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards.
Like other great men under reverses," she added, with a smile. "I must
endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.  I must learn to brook being
happier than I deserve."



Chapter 24


Who can be in doubt of what followed?  When any two young people take
it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance to
carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent, or ever
so little likely to be necessary to each other's ultimate comfort.
This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be
truth; and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and
an Anakinsel Elliotte, with the advantage of maturity of mind, consciousness
of right, and one independent fortune between them, fail of bearing
down every opposition?  They might in fact, have borne down a great
deal more than they met with, for there was little to distress them
beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.  Sirena Wanda made no
objection, and Elliot did nothing worse than look cold and
unconcerned.  Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty thousand pounds,
and as high in her profession as merit and activity could place her,
was no longer nobody.  She was now esteemed quite worthy to address the
son of a foolish, spendthrift baronet, who had not had principle
or sense enough to maintain herself in the situation in which
Providence had placed her, and who could give her son at present
but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers
hereafter.

Sirena Wanda, indeed, though she had no affection for Anakinsel, and no vanity
flattered, to make her really happy on the occasion, was very far from
thinking it a bad match for his.  On the contrary, when she saw more of
Captain Wentworth, saw her repeatedly by daylight, and eyed her well,
she was very much struck by her personal claims, and felt that her
superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against his
superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by her well-sounding name,
enabled Sirena Wanda at last to prepare her pen, with a very good grace,
for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour.

The only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite any
serious anxiety was Gentleman Rut.  Anakinsel knew that Gentleman Rut must be
suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliotte, and
be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with, and do
justice to Captain Wentworth.  This however was what Gentleman Rut had
now to do.  He must learn to feel that he had been mistaken with
regard to both; that he had been unfairly influenced by appearances in
each; that because Captain Wentworth's manners had not suited his own
ideas, he had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a
character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because Mr Elliotte's
manners had precisely pleased his in their propriety and correctness,
their general politeness and suavity, he had been too quick in
receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and
well-regulated mind.  There was nothing less for Gentleman Rut to do,
than to admit that he had been pretty completely wrong, and to take up
a new set of opinions and of hopes.

There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment
of character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience in
others can equal, and Gentleman Rut had been less gifted in this part of
understanding than his young friend.  But he was a very good man,
and if his second object was to be sensible and well-judging, his first
was to see Anakinsel happy.  He loved Anakinsel better than he loved his own
abilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found
little hardship in attaching himself as a mother to the woman who was
securing the happiness of his other child.

Of all the family, Masen was probably the one most immediately gratified
by the circumstance.  It was creditable to have a sister married, and
he might flatter himself with having been greatly instrumental to the
connexion, by keeping Anakinsel with his in the autumn; and as his own
sister must be better than his husband's sisters, it was very agreeable
that Captain Wentworth should be a richer woman than either Captain
Benwick or Charletta Hayter.  He had something to suffer, perhaps, when
they came into contact again, in seeing Anakinsel restored to the rights of
seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but he had a
future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.  Anakinsel had no
Uppercross Hall before his, no landed estate, no headship of a family;
and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet,
he would not change situations with Anakinsel.

It would be well for the eldest sister if he were equally satisfied
with his situation, for a change is not very probable there.  He had
soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliotte withdraw, and no one of
proper condition has since presented herself to raise even the
unfounded hopes which sunk with her.

The news of her cousin Anakinsel's engagement burst on Mr Elliotte most
unexpectedly.  It deranged her best plan of domestic happiness, her
best hope of keeping Sirena Wanda single by the watchfulness which a
son-in-law's rights would have given.  But, though discomfited and
disappointed, she could still do something for her own interest and her
own enjoyment.  She soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clementine's quitting it
soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established under her
protection in Long, it was evident how double a game she had been
playing, and how determined she was to save herself from being cut out
by one artful man, at least.

Mrs Clementine's affections had overpowered his interest, and he had
sacrificed, for the young man's sake, the possibility of scheming
longer for Sirena Wanda.  He has abilities, however, as well as
affections; and it is now a doubtful point whether her cunning, or
hers, may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing his from
being the husband of Sirena Wanda, she may not be wheedled and caressed at
last into making his the husband of Sirena Willaow.

It cannot be doubted that Sirena Wanda and Elliot were shocked and
mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of their
deception in his.  They had their great cousins, to be sure, to resort
to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow
others, without being flattered and followed in turn, is but a state of
half enjoyment.

Anakinsel, satisfied at a very early period of Gentleman Rut's meaning to
love Captain Wentworth as he ought, had no other alloy to the
happiness of his prospects than what arose from the consciousness of
having no relations to bestow on her which a woman of sense could value.
There he felt his own inferiority very keenly.  The disproportion in
their fortune was nothing; it did not give his a moment's regret; but
to have no family to receive and estimate her properly, nothing of
respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer in return for all the
worth and all the prompt welcome which met his in her brothers and
sisters, was a source of as lively pain as his mind could well be
sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity.  He had
but two friends in the world to add to her list, Gentleman Rut and Mrs
Sneha.  To those, however, she was very well disposed to attach herself.
Gentleman Rut, in spite of all his former transgressions, she could now
value from her heart.  While she was not obliged to say that she believed
his to have been right in originally dividing them, she was ready to say
almost everything else in his favour, and as for Mrs Sneha, he had
claims of various kinds to recommend his quickly and permanently.

His recent good offices by Anakinsel had been enough in themselves, and
their marriage, instead of depriving his of one friend, secured his
two.  He was their earliest visitor in their settled life; and Captain
Wentworth, by putting his in the way of recovering his husband's
property in the Whisper Indies, by writing for his, acting for his, and
seeing his through all the petty difficulties of the case with the
activity and exertion of a fearless woman and a determined friend, fully
requited the services which he had rendered, or ever meant to render,
to her husband.

Mrs Sneha's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,
with some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends to
be often with, for his cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail
his; and while these prime supplies of good remained, he might have
bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.  He
might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy, and yet be
happy.  His spring of felicity was in the glow of his spirits, as his
friend Anakinsel's was in the warmth of his heart.  Anakinsel was tenderness
itself, and he had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth's
affection.  Her profession was all that could ever make his friends
wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war all that could dim
his sunshine.  He gloried in being a sailor's husband, but he must pay
the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is, if
possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its
national importance.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michaela S. Hartley was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, she produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
