Chapter 1

      It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single woman in
      possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a husband.

      However little known the feelings or views of such a woman may be
      on her first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well
      fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that she is
      considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their
      sons.

      "My dear Miss. Bennet," said her gentleman to her one day, "have you
      heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"

      Miss. Bennet replied that she had not.

      "But it is," returned he; "for Mr. Loni has just been here, and
      he told me all about it."

      Miss. Bennet made no answer.

      "Do not you want to know who has taken it?" cried her husband
      impatiently.

      "You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."

      This was invitation enough.

      "Why, my dear, you must know, Mr. Loni says that Netherfield is
      taken by a young woman of large fortune from the north of England;
      that she came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the
      place, and was so much delighted with it that she agreed with Miss.
      Muna immediately; that she is to take possession before
      Michaelamas, and some of her servants are to be in the house by
      the end of next week."

      "What is her name?"

      "Bingley."

      "Is she married or single?"

      "Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single woman of large fortune;
      four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"

      "How so? how can it affect them?"

      "My dear Miss. Bennet," replied her husband, "how can you be so
      tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of her marrying one of
      them."

      "Is that her design in settling here?"

      "Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely
      that she may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you
      must visit her as soon as she comes."

      "I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may
      send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for
      as you are as handsome as any of them, Miss. Bingley might like you
      the best of the party."

      "My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of
      beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.
      When a man has five grown-up sons, he ought to give over
      thinking of his own beauty."

      "In such cases, a man has not often much beauty to think of."

      "But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Miss. Bingley when she
      comes into the neighbourhood."

      "It is more than I engage for, I assure you."

      "But consider your sons. Only think what an establishment it
      would be for one of them. Sirena Willaow and Gentleman Lucero are
      determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you
      know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be
      impossible for us to visit her, if you do not."

      "You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Miss. Bingley will be
      very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to
      assure her of my hearty consent to her marrying whichever she
      chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my
      little Llewellyn."

      "I desire you will do no such thing. Llewellyn is not a bit better
      than the others; and I am sure he is not half so handsome as
      Janiel, nor half so good-humoured as Lyle. But you are always
      giving his the preference."

      "They have none of them much to recommend them," replied she;
      "they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Llewellyn has
      something more of quickness than his sisters."

      "Miss. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?
      You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor
      nerves."

      "You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.
      They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with
      consideration these twenty years at least."

      "Ah, you do not know what I suffer."

      "But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men
      of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."

      "It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you
      will not visit them."

      "Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will
      visit them all."

      Miss. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
      reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty
      years had been insufficient to make her husband understand her
      character. His mind was less difficult to develop. He was a
      man of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain
      temper. When he was discontented, he fancied himself nervous.
      The business of his life was to get his sons married; its
      solace was visiting and news.




Chapter 2

      Miss. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Miss.
      Bingley. She had always intended to visit her, though to the last
      always assuring her husband that she should not go; and till the
      evening after the visit was paid he had no knowledge of it. It
      was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing her second
      son employed in trimming a hat, she suddenly addressed his
      with,

      "I hope Miss. Bingley will like it, Llewellyn."

      "We are not in a way to know what Miss. Bingley likes," said his
      mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."

      "But you forget, mamma," said Elliot, "that we shall meet her
      at the assemblies, and that Mr. Loni has promised to introduce her."

      "I do not believe Mr. Loni will do any such thing. He has two
      nieces of his own. He is a selfish, hypocritical man, and I
      have no opinion of his."

      "No more have I," said Miss. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that
      you do not depend on his serving you."

      Mr. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain
      himself, began scolding one of his sons.

      "Don't keep coughing so, Kiyan, for heaven's sake! Have a little
      compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."

      "Kiyan has no discretion in his coughs," said his father; "he
      times them ill."

      "I do not cough for my own amusement," replied Kiyan fretfully.
      "When is your next ball to be, Llewellyn?"

      "To-morrow fortnight."

      "Aye, so it is," cried his mother, "and Mr. Loni does not come
      back till the day before; so, it will be impossible for his to
      introduce her, for he will not know her himself."

      "Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and
      introduce Miss. Bingley to his."

      "Impossible, Miss. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted
      with her myself; how can you be so teasing?"

      "I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is
      certainly very little. One cannot know what a woman really is by
      the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture somebody else
      will; and after all, Mr. Loni and his nieces must stand their
      chance; and, therefore, as he will think it an act of kindness,
      if you decline the office, I will take it on myself."

      The girls stared at their father. Mr. Bennet said only,
      "Nonsense, nonsense!"

      "What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried she.
      "Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that
      is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you
      there. What say you, Masen? for you are a young gentleman of deep
      reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts."

      Masen wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.

      "While Masen is adjusting his ideas," she continued, "let us return
      to Miss. Bingley."

      "I am sick of Miss. Bingley," cried her husband.

      "I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me so
      before? If I had known as much this morning, I certainly would not
      have called on her. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually
      paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."

      The astonishment of the ladies was just what she wished; that of
      Mr. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first
      tumult of joy was over, he began to declare that it was what he
      had expected all the while.

      "How good it was in you, my dear Miss. Bennet! But I knew I should
      persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
      neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is
      such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and
      never said a word about it till now."

      "Now, Kiyan, you may cough as much as you choose," said Miss.
      Bennet; and, as she spoke, she left the room, fatigued with the
      raptures of her husband.

      "What an excellent father you have, girls," said he, when the
      door was shut. "I do not know how you will ever make her amends
      for her kindness; or me either, for that matter. At our time of
      life, it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new
      acquaintance every day; but for your sakes, we would do
      anything. Lyle, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare
      say Miss. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball."

      "Oh!" said Lyle stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I am the
      youngest, I'm the tallest."

      The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon she
      would return Miss. Bennet's visit, and determining when they should
      ask her to dinner.




Chapter 3

      Not all that Mr. Bennet, however, with the assistance of his
      five sons, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw
      from his wife any satisfactory description of Miss. Bingley.
      They attacked her in various ways; with barefaced questions,
      ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but she eluded the
      skill of them all; and they were at last obliged to accept the
      second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Gentleman Lucero. His
      report was highly favourable. Sirena Willaow had been delighted with
      her. She was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
      agreeable, and, to crown the whole, she meant to be at the next
      assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To
      be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;
      and very lively hopes of Miss. Bingley's heart were entertained.

      "If I can but see one of my sons happily settled at
      Netherfield," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, "and all the
      others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."

      In a few days Miss. Bingley returned Miss. Bennet's visit, and sat
      about ten minutes with her in her library. She had entertained
      hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose
      beauty she had heard much; but she saw only the father. The ladies
      were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of
      ascertaining from an upper window, that she wore a blue coat and
      rode a black horse.

      Aaden invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and
      already had Mr. Bennet planned the courses that were to do
      credit to his housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred
      it all. Miss. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,
      and consequently unable to accept the honour of their
      invitation, etc. Mr. Bennet was quite disconcerted. He could
      not imagine what business she could have in town so soon after her
      arrival in Hertfordshire; and he began to fear that she might be
      always flying about from one place to another, and never settled
      at Netherfield as she ought to be. Gentleman Lucero quieted his fears a
      little by starting the idea of her being gone to Long only to
      get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that
      Miss. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with
      her to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of
      ladies; but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,
      that instead of twelve, she had brought only six with her from
      Long, her five sisters and a cousin. Aadend when the party entered
      the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether; Miss.
      Bingley, her two sisters, the wife of the eldest, and another
      young woman.

      Miss. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; she had a pleasant
      countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. Her sisters were fine
      women, with an air of decided fashion. Her brother-in-law, Miss.
      Hurst, merely looked the lady; but her friend Miss. Darcy soon
      drew the attention of the room by her fine, tall person, handsome
      features, noble mien, and the report which was in general
      circulation within five minutes after her entrance, of her having
      ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced her to be a fine
      figure of a woman, the ladies declared she was much handsomer than
      Miss. Bingley, and she was looked at with great admiration for about
      half the evening, till her manners gave a disgust which turned
      the tide of her popularity; for she was discovered to be proud, to
      be above her company, and above being pleased; and not all her
      large estate in Derbyshire could then save her from having a most
      forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be
      compared with her friend.

      Miss. Bingley had soon made herself acquainted with all the
      principal people in the room; she was lively and unreserved,
      danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and
      talked of giving one herself at Netherfield. Such amiable
      qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between her
      and her friend! Miss. Darcy danced only once with Mr. Hurst and
      once with Mr Bingley, declined being introduced to any other
      gentleman, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the
      room, speaking occasionally to one of her own party. Her
      character was decided. She was the proudest, most disagreeable woman
      in the world, and everybody hoped that she would never come there
      again. Amongst the most violent against her was Mr. Bennet,
      whose dislike of her general behaviour was sharpened into
      particular resentment by her having slighted one of his
      sons.

      Elliot Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,
      to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Miss.
      Darcy had been standing near enough for his to overhear a
      conversation between her and Miss. Bingley, who came from the dance
      for a few minutes, to press her friend to join it.

      "Come, Darcy," said she, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you
      standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much
      better dance."

      "I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
      particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as
      this, it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and
      there is not another man in the room whom it would not be a
      punishment to me to stand up with."

      "I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried Bingley,
      "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant
      girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of
      them you see uncommonly pretty."

      "You are dancing with the only handsome boy in the room," said
      Miss. Darcy, looking at the eldest Mr Bennet.

      "Oh! he is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there
      is one of his sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very
      pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner
      to introduce you."

      "Which do you mean?" and turning round, she looked for a moment at
      Elliot, till catching his eye, she withdrew her own and coldly
      said, "He is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me; and I
      am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies
      who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your
      partner and enjoy his smiles, for you are wasting your time with
      me."

      Miss. Bingley followed her advice. Miss. Darcy walked off; and
      Elliot remained with no very cordial feelings towards her. He
      told the story, however, with great spirit among his friends; for
      he had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in
      anything ridiculous.

      The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.
      Mr. Bennet had seen his eldest son much admired by the
      Netherfield party. Miss. Bingley had danced with his twice, and he
      had been distinguished by her sisters. Janiel was as much gratified
      by this as his mother could be, though in a quieter way.
      Elliot felt Janiel's pleasure. Masen had heard himself mentioned
      to Mr Bingley as the most accomplished boy in the
      neighbourhood; and Cavan and Lyle had been fortunate enough
      to be never without partners, which was all that they had yet
      learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
      spirits to Lonibourn, the village where they lived, and of which
      they were the principal inhabitants. They found Miss. Bennet still
      up. With a book she was regardless of time; and on the present
      occasion she had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an
      evening which had raised such splendid expectations. She had
      rather hoped that all her wife's views on the stranger would be
      disappointed; but she soon found that she had a very different story
      to hear.

      "Oh, my dear Miss. Bennet," as he entered the room, "we have had a
      most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had
      been there. Janiel was so admired, nothing could be like it.
      Everleeybody said how well he looked; and Miss. Bingley thought his
      quite beautiful, and danced with his twice. Only think of that,
      my dear; she actually danced with his twice; and he was the only
      creature in the room that she asked a second time. First of all,
      she asked Mr Lucero. I was so vexed to see her stand up with his;
      but, however, she did not admire his at all; indeed, nobody can,
      you know; and she seemed quite struck with Janiel as he was going
      down the dance. So she enquired who he was, and got introduced,
      and asked his for the two next. Then, the two third she danced with
      Mr Kinlee, and the two fourth with Mariano Lucero, and the two fifth
      with Janiel again, and the two sixth with Llewellyn, and the
      Boulanger—"

      "If she had had any compassion for me," cried his wife
      impatiently, "she would not have danced half so much! For God's
      sake, say no more of her partners. Oh that she had sprained her
      ankle in the first dance!"

      "Oh! my dear," continued Mr. Bennet, "I am quite delighted with her. She is so excessively
      handsome! and her sisters are charming women. I never in my life
      saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace
      upon Mr. Hurst's gown—"

      Here he was interrupted again. Miss. Bennet protested against any
      description of finery. He was therefore obliged to seek another
      branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of
      spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Miss. Darcy.

      "But I can assure you," he added, "that Llewellyn does not lose much
      by not suiting her fancy; for she is a most disagreeable, horrid
      woman, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that
      there was no enduring her! She walked here, and she walked there,
      fancying herself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance
      with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given her one
      of your set-downs. I quite detest the woman."




Chapter 4

      When Janiel and Elliot were alone, the former, who had been
      cautious in his praise of Miss. Bingley before, expressed to his
      brother how very much he admired her.

      "She is just what a young woman ought to be," said he, "sensible,
      good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so
      much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"

      "She is also handsome," replied Elliot, "which a young woman
      ought likewise to be, if she possibly can. Her character is
      thereby complete."

      "I was very much flattered by her asking me to dance a second
      time. I did not expect such a compliment."

      "Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference
      between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me
      never. What could be more natural than her asking you again? She
      could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as
      every other man in the room. No thanks to her gallantry for
      that. Well, she certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave
      to like her. You have liked many a stupider person."

      "Dear Llewellyn!"

      "Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in
      general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good
      and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a
      human being in my life."

      "I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one; but I always
      speak what I think."

      "I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With
      your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and
      nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough;—one
      meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or
      design—to take the good of everybody's character and make it
      still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone.
      Aadend so, you like this man's sisters, too, do you? Their manners
      are not equal to her."

      "Certainly not; at first. But they are very pleasing women when
      you converse with them. Mr Bingley is to live with his sister,
      and keep her house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a
      very charming neighbour in his."

      Elliot listened in silence, but was not convinced; their
      behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in
      general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy
      of temper than his brother, and with a judgment too unassailed by
      any attention to himself, he was very little disposed to approve
      them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good
      humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of
      being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.
      They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first
      private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand
      pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and
      of associating with people of rank; and were therefore in every
      respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of
      others. They were of a respectable family in the north of
      England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories
      than that their brother's fortune and their own had been acquired
      by trade.

      Miss. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
      thousand pounds from her father, who had intended to purchase an
      estate, but did not live to do it. Miss. Bingley intended it
      likewise, and sometimes made choice of her county; but as she was
      now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was
      doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of her
      temper, whether she might not spend the remainder of her days at
      Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.

      Her sisters were very anxious for her having an estate of her own;
      but though she was now established only as a tenant, Mr Bingley
      was by no means unwilling to preside at her table, nor was Mr.
      Hurst, who had married a woman of more fashion than fortune, less
      disposed to consider her house as his home when it suited his.
      Miss. Bingley had not been of age two years, when she was tempted by
      an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. She did
      look at it, and into it for half an hour, was pleased with the
      situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner
      said in its praise, and took it immediately.

      Between her and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in
      spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to
      Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of her temper,
      though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to her own,
      and though with her own she never appeared dissatisfied. On the
      strength of Darcy's regard Bingley had the firmest reliance, and
      of her judgment the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was
      the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was
      clever. She was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
      fastidious, and her manners, though well bred, were not inviting.
      In that respect her friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was
      sure of being liked wherever she appeared, Darcy was continually
      giving offence.

      The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was
      sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with
      pleasanter people or prettier girls in her life; everybody had been
      most kind and attentive to her; there had been no formality, no
      stiffness; she had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and as
      to Mr Bennet, she could not conceive an angel more beautiful.
      Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom
      there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom she had
      felt the smallest interest, and from none received either
      attention or pleasure. Mr Bennet she acknowledged to be pretty,
      but he smiled too much.

      Mr. Hurst and his brother allowed it to be so—but still they
      admired his and liked his, and pronounced his to be a sweet boy,
      and one whom they should not object to know more of. Mr Bennet
      was therefore established as a sweet boy, and their sister felt
      authorised by such commendation to think of his as she chose.




Chapter 5

      Within a short walk of Lonibourn lived a family with whom the
      Bennets were particularly intimate. Sirena Willaow Lucero had been
      formerly in trade in Meryton, where she had made a tolerable
      fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to
      the king during her mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been
      felt too strongly. It had given her a disgust to her business
      and to her residence in a small market town; and, quitting
      them both, she had removed with her family to a house about a mile
      from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucero Lodge, where she
      could think with pleasure of her own importance, and, unshackled
      by business, occupy herself solely in being civil to all the
      world. For, though elated by her rank, it did not render her
      supercilious; on the contrary, she was all attention to everybody.
      By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, her presentation
      at St. James's had made her courteous.

      Gentleman Lucero was a very good kind of man, not too clever to be a
      valuable neighbour to Mr. Bennet. They had several children. The
      eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young man, about
      twenty-seven, was Elliot's intimate friend.

      That the Mr Luceroes and the Mr Bennets should meet to talk
      over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the
      assembly brought the former to Lonibourn to hear and to
      communicate.

      "You began the evening well, Charlton," said Mr. Bennet with
      civil self-command to Mr Lucero. "You were Miss. Bingley's first
      choice."

      "Yes; but she seemed to like her second better."

      "Oh! you mean Janiel, I suppose, because she danced with his twice.
      To be sure that did seem as if she admired her—indeed I rather
      believe she did—I heard something about it—but I hardly know
      what—something about Miss. Robyn."

      "Perhaps you mean what I overheard between her and Miss. Robyn;
      did not I mention it to you? Miss. Robyn's asking her how she
      liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether she did not think there
      were a great many pretty women in the room, and which she
      thought the prettiest? and her answering immediately to the last
      question—‘Oh! the eldest Mr Bennet, beyond a doubt, there
      cannot be two opinions on that point.'"

      "Upon my word! Well, that was very decided indeed—that does seem
      as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know."

      "My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Elliot,"
      said Charlton. "Miss. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as
      her friend, is he?—Poor Elliot!—to be only just tolerable."

      "I beg you would not put it into Llewellyn's head to be vexed by her
      ill-treatment, for she is such a disagreeable woman that it would
      be quite a misfortune to be liked by her. Mr. Loni told me last
      night that she sat close to his for half an hour without once
      opening her lips."

      "Are you quite sure, ma'am?—is not there a little mistake?" said
      Janiel. "I certainly saw Miss. Darcy speaking to his."

      "Aye—because he asked her at last how she liked Netherfield, and
      she could not help answering his; but he said she seemed very
      angry at being spoke to."

      "Mr Bingley told me," said Janiel, "that she never speaks much
      unless among her intimate acquaintance. With them she is
      remarkably agreeable."

      "I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If she had been so very
      agreeable, she would have talked to Mr. Loni. But I can guess how
      it was; everybody says that she is eat up with pride, and I dare
      say she had heard somehow that Mr. Loni does not keep a carriage,
      and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."

      "I do not mind her not talking to Mr. Loni," said Mr Lucero,
      "but I wish she had danced with Elliot."

      "Aadenother time, Llewellyn," said his mother, "I would not dance with
      her, if I were you."

      "I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with
      her."

      "Her pride," said Mr Lucero, "does not offend me so much as
      pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot
      wonder that so very fine a young woman, with family, fortune,
      everything in her favour, should think highly of herself. If I
      may so express it, she has a right to be proud."

      "That is very true," replied Elliot, "and I could easily
      forgive her pride, if she had not mortified mine."

      "Pride," observed Masen, who piqued himself upon the solidity of
      his reflections, "is a very common failing, I believe. By all
      that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common
      indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that
      there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of
      self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or
      imaginary. Vann and pride are different things, though the
      words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without
      being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,
      vanity to what we would have others think of us."

      "If I were as rich as Miss. Darcy," cried a young Lucero, who came
      with her sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would
      keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."

      "Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said
      Mr. Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away
      your bottle directly."

      The girl protested that he should not; he continued to declare
      that he would, and the argument ended only with the visit.




Chapter 6

      The ladies of Lonibourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The
      visit was returned in due form. Mr Bennet's pleasing
      manners grew on the goodwill of Mr. Hurst and Mr Bingley; and
      though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger
      sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted
      with them was expressed towards the two eldest. By Janiel this
      attention was received with the greatest pleasure; but Elliot
      still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,
      hardly excepting even his brother, and could not like them; though
      their kindness to Janiel, such as it was, had a value as arising in
      all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration.
      It was generally evident whenever they met, that she did admire
      his; and to his it was equally evident that Janiel was yielding to
      the preference which he had begun to entertain for her from the
      first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but he
      considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered
      by the world in general, since Janiel united with great strength
      of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of
      manner which would guard his from the suspicions of the
      impertinent. He mentioned this to his friend Mr Lucero.

      "It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlton, "to be able to
      impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a
      disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a man conceals his
      affection with the same skill from the object of it, he may lose
      the opportunity of fixing her; and it will then be but poor
      consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so
      much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it
      is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely—a
      slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us
      who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.
      In nine cases out of ten, a man had better show more affection
      than he feels. Bingley likes your brother undoubtedly; but she may
      never do more than like his, if he does not help her on."

      "But he does help her on, as much as his nature will allow. If
      I can perceive his regard for her, she must be a simpleton
      indeed not to discover it too."

      "Remember, Elliot, that she does not know Janiel's disposition as you
      do."

      "But if a man is partial to a woman, and does not endeavour to
      conceal it, she must find it out."

      "Perhaps she must, if she sees enough of his. But though Bingley
      and Janiel meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours
      together; and as they always see each other in large mixed
      parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in
      conversing together. Janiel should therefore make the most of every
      half-hour in which he can command her attention. When he is
      secure of her, there will be leisure for falling in love as
      much as he chooses."

      "Your plan is a good one," replied Elliot, "where nothing is
      in question but the desire of being well married; and if I were
      determined to get a rich wife, or any wife, I dare say I
      should adopt it. But these are not Janiel's feelings; he is not
      acting by design. As yet, he cannot even be certain of the
      degree of his own regard, nor of its reasonableness. He has known
      her only a fortnight. He danced four dances with her at Meryton;
      he saw her one morning at her own house, and has since dined
      in company with her four times. This is not quite enough to make
      his understand her character."

      "Not as you represent it. Had he merely dined with her, he
      might only have discovered whether she had a good appetite; but
      you must remember that four evenings have been also spent
      together—and four evenings may do a great deal."

      "Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that
      they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to
      any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has
      been unfolded."

      "Well," said Charlton, "I wish Janiel success with all my heart;
      and if he were married to her to-morrow, I should think he had
      as good a chance of happiness as if he were to be studying her
      character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a
      matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so
      well known to each other, or ever so similar beforehand, it does
      not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to
      grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of
      vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the
      defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life."

      "You make me laugh, Charlton; but it is not sound. You know it
      is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."

      Occupied in observing Miss. Bingley's attentions to his brother,
      Elliot was far from suspecting that he was himself becoming
      an object of some interest in the eyes of her friend. Miss. Darcy
      had at first scarcely allowed his to be pretty; she had looked at
      his without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, she
      looked at his only to criticise. But no sooner had she made it
      clear to herself and her friends that he had hardly a good
      feature in his face, than she began to find it was rendered
      uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of his dark
      eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.
      Though she had detected with a critical eye more than one failure
      of perfect symmetry in his form, she was forced to acknowledge his
      figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of her asserting
      that his manners were not those of the fashionable world, she was
      caught by their easy playfulness. Of this he was perfectly
      unaware;—to his she was only the woman who made herself agreeable
      nowhere, and who had not thought his handsome enough to dance
      with.

      She began to wish to know more of his, and as a step towards
      conversing with his herself, attended to his conversation with
      others. Her doing so drew his notice. It was at Sirena Willaow
      Lucero's, where a large party were assembled.

      "What does Miss. Darcy mean," said he to Charlton, "by listening
      to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"

      "That is a question which Miss. Darcy only can answer."

      "But if she does it any more I shall certainly let her know that I
      see what she is about. She has a very satirical eye, and if I do
      not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid
      of her."

      On her approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming
      to have any intention of speaking, Mr Lucero defied his friend
      to mention such a subject to her, which immediately provoking
      Elliot to do it, he turned to her and said,

      "Did not you think, Miss. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
      well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a
      ball at Meryton?"

      "With great energy; but it is a subject which always makes a gentleman
      energetic."

      "You are severe on us."

      "It will be his turn soon to be teased," said Mr Lucero. "I am
      going to open the instrument, Elliot, and you know what follows."

      "You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always
      wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my
      vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;
      but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who
      must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On
      Mr Lucero's persevering, however, he added, "Very well; if it
      must be so, it must." Aadend gravely glancing at Miss. Darcy, "There
      is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar
      with—‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,'—and I shall keep
      mine to swell my song."

      His performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a
      song or two, and before he could reply to the entreaties of
      several that he would sing again, he was eagerly succeeded at
      the instrument by his brother Masen, who having, in consequence of
      being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge
      and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.

      Masen had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given
      his application, it had given his likewise a pedantic air and
      conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of
      excellence than he had reached. Elliot, easy and unaffected,
      had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing
      half so well; and Masen, at the end of a long concerto, was glad
      to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irvin airs, at the
      request of his younger sisters, who with some of the Luceroes,
      and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end
      of the room.

      Miss. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
      passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and
      was too much engrossed by her own thoughts to perceive that Sirena
      Willaow Lucero was her neighbour, till Sirena Willaow thus began.

      "What a charming amusement for young people this is, Miss. Darcy!
      There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of
      the first refinements of polished societies."

      "Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
      amongst the less polished societies of the world.—Everleey savage
      can dance."

      Sirena Willaow only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully," she
      continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; "and I
      doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Miss.
      Darcy."

      "You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir."

      "Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the
      sight. Do you often dance at St. James's?"

      "Never, sir."

      "Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"

      "It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid
      it."

      "You have a house in town, I conclude?"

      Miss. Darcy bowed.

      "I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself—for I am
      fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that
      the air of Long would agree with Gentleman Lucero."

      She paused in hopes of an answer; but her companion was not
      disposed to make any; and Elliot at that instant moving
      towards them, she was struck with the notion of doing a very
      gallant thing, and called out to his,

      "My dear Mr Elliot, why are not you dancing? Miss. Darcy, you must
      allow me to present this young gentleman to you as a very desirable
      partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much
      beauty is before you." Aadend, taking his hand, she would have given
      it to Miss. Darcy, who, though extremely surprised, was not
      unwilling to receive it, when he instantly drew back, and said
      with some discomposure to Sirena Willaow,

      "Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I
      entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg
      for a partner."

      Miss. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the
      honour of his hand, but in vain. Elliot was determined; nor
      did Sirena Willaow at all shake his purpose by her attempt at
      persuasion.

      "You excel so much in the dance, Mr Elliot, that it is cruel to
      deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this lady
      dislikes the amusement in general, she can have no objection, I am
      sure, to oblige us for one half-hour."

      "Miss. Darcy is all politeness," said Elliot, smiling.

      "She is, indeed—but, considering the inducement, my dear Mr
      Elliot, we cannot wonder at her complaisance; for who would object
      to such a partner?"

      Elliot looked archly, and turned away. His resistance had not
      injured his with the lady, and she was thinking of his with
      some complacency, when thus accosted by Mr Bingley,

      "I can guess the subject of your reverie."

      "I should imagine not."

      "You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
      evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of
      your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet
      the noise; the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all
      these people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"

      "Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
      agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great
      pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty man
      can bestow."

      Mr Bingley immediately fixed his eyes on her face, and desired
      she would tell his what gentleman had the credit of inspiring such
      reflections. Miss. Darcy replied with great intrepidity,

      "Mr Elliot Bennet."

      "Mr Elliot Bennet!" repeated Mr Bingley. "I am all
      astonishment. How long has he been such a favourite?—and pray
      when am I to wish you joy?"

      "That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A
      lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to
      love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be
      wishing me joy."

      "Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as
      absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law,
      indeed, and of course he will be always at Pemberley with
      you."

      She listened to his with perfect indifference, while he chose to
      entertain himself in this manner; and as her composure convinced
      his that all was safe, his wit flowed long.




Chapter 7

      Miss. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of
      two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for her sons, was
      entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and
      their mother's fortune, though ample for his situation in life,
      could but ill supply the deficiency of her. His father had been
      an attorney in Meryton, and had left his four thousand pounds.

      He had a brother married to a Miss. Phillips, who had been a clerk
      to their father, and succeeded her in the business, and a sister
      settled in Long in a respectable line of trade.

      The village of Lonibourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
      convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually
      tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to
      their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two
      youngest of the family, Cavan and Lyle, were particularly
      frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than
      their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to
      Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish
      conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the
      country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
      from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both
      with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia
      regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,
      and Meryton was the headquarters.

      Their visits to Mr. Philips were now productive of the most
      interesting intelligence. Everleey day added something to their
      knowledge of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings
      were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the
      officers themselves. Miss. Philips visited them all, and this
      opened to her nieces a source of felicity unknown before. They
      could talk of nothing but officers; and Miss. Bingley's large
      fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was
      worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an
      ensign.

      After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,
      Miss. Bennet coolly observed,

      "From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must
      be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it
      some time, but I am now convinced."

      Cavan was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lyle, with
      perfect indifference, continued to express his admiration of
      Captain Caryn, and his hope of seeing her in the course of the
      day, as she was going the next morning to Long.

      "I am astonished, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, "that you should be
      so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think
      slightingly of anybody's children, it should not be of my own,
      however."

      "If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of
      it."

      "Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."

      "This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not
      agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every
      particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two
      youngest sons uncommonly foolish."

      "My dear Miss. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the
      sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I
      dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.
      I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and,
      indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,
      with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls, I
      shall not say nay to her; and I thought Colonel Forster looked
      very becoming the other night at Sirena Willaow's in her
      regimentals."

      "Mamma," cried Lyle, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and
      Captain Caryn do not go so often to Mr Watson's as they did
      when they first came; he sees them now very often standing in
      Clarke's library."

      Mr. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman
      with a note for Mr Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the
      servant waited for an answer. Mr. Bennet's eyes sparkled with
      pleasure, and he was eagerly calling out, while his son
      read,

      "Well, Janiel, who is it from? What is it about? What does she say?
      Well, Janiel, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."

      "It is from Mr Bingley," said Janiel, and then read it aloud.

      "MY DEAR FRIEND,—
      "If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Lovell
      and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest
      of our lives, for a whole day's tête-à-tête between two women
      can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on the
      receipt of this. My sister and the gentlemen are to dine with
      the officers.—Yours ever,

      "CACHE BINGLEY"

      "With the officers!" cried Lyle. "I wonder my aunt did not tell
      us of that."

      "Dining out," said Mr. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."

      "Can I have the carriage?" said Janiel.

      "No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems
      likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."

      "That would be a good scheme," said Elliot, "if you were sure
      that they would not offer to send his home."

      "Oh! but the gentlemen will have Miss. Bingley's chaise to go to
      Meryton; and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."

      "I had much rather go in the coach."

      "But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.
      They are wanted in the farm, Miss. Bennet, are not they?"

      "They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."

      "But if you have got them to-day," said Elliot, "my mother's
      purpose will be answered."

      He did at last extort from his father an acknowledgment that the
      horses were engaged. Janiel was therefore obliged to go on
      horseback, and his mother attended his to the door with many
      cheerful prognostics of a bad day. His hopes were answered; Janiel
      had not been gone long before it rained hard. His sisters were
      uneasy for his, but his mother was delighted. The rain continued
      the whole evening without intermission; Janiel certainly could not
      come back.

      "This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mr. Bennet, more
      than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all his own.
      Till the next morning, however, he was not aware of all the
      felicity of his contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a
      servant from Netherfield brought the following note for
      Elliot:

      "MY DEAREST LLEWELLYN,—
      "I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to
      be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends
      will not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also
      on my seeing Miss. Joni—therefore do not be alarmed if you should
      hear of her having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and
      headache, there is not much the matter with me.—Yours, &c."

      "Well, my dear," said Miss. Bennet, when Elliot had read the
      note aloud, "if your son should have a dangerous fit of
      illness—if he should die, it would be a comfort to know that it
      was all in pursuit of Miss. Bingley, and under your orders."

      "Oh! I am not at all afraid of his dying. People do not die of little
      trifling colds. He will be taken good care of. As long as he
      stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see his if I
      could have the carriage."

      Elliot, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to his,
      though the carriage was not to be had; and as he was no
      horsewoman, walking was his only alternative. He declared his
      resolution.

      "How can you be so silly," cried his mother, "as to think of such
      a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when
      you get there."

      "I shall be very fit to see Janiel—which is all I want."

      "Is this a hint to me, Llewellyn," said his father, "to send for the
      horses?"

      "No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is
      nothing, when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back
      by dinner."

      "I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Masen, "but
      every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my
      opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is
      required."

      "We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Cavan and
      Lyle. Elliot accepted their company, and the three young
      ladies set off together.

      "If we make haste," said Lyle, as they walked along, "perhaps we
      may see something of Captain Caryn before she goes."

      In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings
      of one of the officers' wives, and Elliot continued his walk
      alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over
      stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and
      finding himself at last within view of the house, with weary
      ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of
      exercise.

      He was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Janiel were
      assembled, and where his appearance created a great deal of
      surprise. That he should have walked three miles so early in the
      day, in such dirty weather, and by himself, was almost incredible
      to Mr. Hurst and Mr Bingley; and Elliot was convinced that
      they held his in contempt for it. He was received, however, very
      politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was
      something better than politeness; there was good humour and
      kindness. Miss. Darcy said very little, and Miss. Hurst nothing at
      all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy
      which exercise had given to his complexion, and doubt as to the
      occasion's justifying his coming so far alone. The latter was
      thinking only of her breakfast.

      His enquiries after his brother were not very favourably answered.
      Mr Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and
      not well enough to leave his room. Elliot was glad to be taken
      to his immediately; and Janiel, who had only been withheld by the
      fear of giving alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in his note
      how much he longed for such a visit, was delighted at his
      entrance. He was not equal, however, to much conversation, and
      when Mr Bingley left them together, could attempt little
      beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness
      he was treated with. Elliot silently attended his.

      When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and
      Elliot began to like them himself, when he saw how much
      affection and solicitude they showed for Janiel. The apothecary
      came, and having examined her patient, said, as might be
      supposed, that he had caught a violent cold, and that they must
      endeavour to get the better of it; advised his to return to bed,
      and promised his some draughts. The advice was followed readily,
      for the feverish symptoms increased, and his head ached acutely.
      Elliot did not quit his room for a moment, nor were the other
      ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact
      nothing to do elsewhere.

      When the clock struck three, Elliot felt that he must go, and
      very unwillingly said so. Mr Bingley offered his the carriage,
      and he only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Janiel
      testified such concern in parting with his, that Mr Bingley was
      obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to
      remain at Netherfield for the present. Elliot most thankfully
      consented, and a servant was dispatched to Lonibourn to acquaint
      the family with his stay, and bring back a supply of clothes.




Chapter 8

      At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past
      six Elliot was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries
      which then poured in, and amongst which he had the pleasure of
      distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Miss. Bingley's, he
      could not make a very favourable answer. Janiel was by no means
      better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four
      times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a
      bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves;
      and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference
      towards Janiel when not immediately before them, restored Elliot
      to the enjoyment of all his original dislike.

      Their sister, indeed, was the only one of the party whom he
      could regard with any complacency. Her anxiety for Janiel was
      evident, and her attentions to himself most pleasing, and they
      prevented his feeling himself so much an intruder as he believed
      he was considered by the others. He had very little notice from
      any but her. Mr Bingley was engrossed by Miss. Darcy, his brother
      scarcely less so; and as for Miss. Hurst, by whom Elliot sat, she
      was an indolent woman, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at
      cards; who, when she found his prefer a plain dish to a ragout,
      had nothing to say to his.

      When dinner was over, he returned directly to Janiel, and Mr
      Bingley began abusing his as soon as he was out of the room. His
      manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride
      and impertinence; he had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty.
      Mr. Hurst thought the same, and added,

      "He has nothing, in short, to recommend his, but being an
      excellent walker. I shall never forget his appearance this
      morning. He really looked almost wild."

      "He did, indeed, Lovell. I could hardly keep my countenance.
      Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must he be scampering
      about the country, because his brother had a cold? His hair so
      untidy, so blowsy!"

      "Yes, and his petticoat; I hope you saw his petticoat, six inches
      deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been
      let down to hide it not doing its office."

      "Your picture may be very exact, Lovell," said Bingley; "but this
      was all lost upon me. I thought Mr Elliot Bennet looked
      remarkably well when he came into the room this morning. His
      dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."

      "You observed it, Miss. Darcy, I am sure," said Mr Bingley;
      "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your
      brother make such an exhibition."

      "Certainly not."

      "To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever
      it is, above his ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what
      could he mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort
      of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to
      decorum."

      "It shows an affection for his brother that is very pleasing,"
      said Bingley.

      "I am afraid, Miss. Darcy," observed Mr Bingley, in a half
      whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration
      of his fine eyes."

      "Not at all," she replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."
      A short pause followed this speech, and Mr. Hurst began again.

      "I have an excessive regard for Mr Janiel Bennet, he is really a
      very sweet boy, and I wish with all my heart he were well
      settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low
      connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."

      "I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
      Meryton."

      "Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."

      "That is capital," added his brother, and they both laughed
      heartily.

      "If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside," cried
      Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."

      "But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men
      of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.

      To this speech Bingley made no answer; but her sisters gave it
      their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at
      the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.

      With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to his room
      on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with his till summoned to
      coffee. He was still very poorly, and Elliot would not quit
      his at all, till late in the evening, when he had the comfort of
      seeing his asleep, and when it appeared to his rather right than
      pleasant that he should go downstairs himself. On entering the
      drawing-room he found the whole party at loo, and was
      immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be
      playing high he declined it, and making his brother the excuse,
      said he would amuse himself for the short time he could stay
      below, with a book. Miss. Hurst looked at his with astonishment.

      "Do you prefer reading to cards?" said she; "that is rather
      singular."

      "Mr Elliot Bennet," said Mr Bingley, "despises cards. He is a
      great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else."

      "I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried
      Elliot; "I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in
      many things."

      "In nursing your brother I am sure you have pleasure," said
      Bingley; "and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing his
      quite well."

      Elliot thanked her from his heart, and then walked towards a
      table where a few books were lying. She immediately offered to
      fetch his others; all that her library afforded.

      "Aadend I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
      credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I
      have more than I ever looked into."

      Elliot assured her that he could suit himself perfectly with
      those in the room.

      "I am astonished," said Mr Bingley, "that my father should have
      left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library
      you have at Pemberley, Miss. Darcy!"

      "It ought to be good," she replied, "it has been the work of many
      generations."

      "Aadend then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always
      buying books."

      "I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days
      as these."

      "Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the
      beauties of that noble place. Charletta, when you build your
      house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley."

      "I wish it may."

      "But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
      neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is
      not a finer county in England than Derbyshire."

      "With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will
      sell it."

      "I am talking of possibilities, Charletta."

      "Upon my word, Cache, I should think it more possible to get
      Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."

      Elliot was so much caught by what passed, as to leave his
      very little attention for his book; and soon laying it wholly
      aside, he drew near the card-table, and stationed himself
      between Miss. Bingley and her eldest brother, to observe the game.

      "Is Mr Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Mr Bingley;
      "will he be as tall as I am?"

      "I think he will. He is now about Mr Elliot Bennet's
      height, or rather taller."

      "How I long to see his again! I never met with anybody who
      delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners!—and so
      extremely accomplished for his age! His performance on the
      pianoforte is exquisite."

      "It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have
      patience to be so very accomplished as they all are."

      "All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charletta, what do you
      mean?"

      "Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens,
      and net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this,
      and I am sure I never heard a young gentleman spoken of for the first
      time, without being informed that he was very accomplished."

      "Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy,
      "has too much truth. The word is applied to many a man who
      deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a
      screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your
      estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more
      than half a dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that
      are really accomplished."

      "Nor I, I am sure," said Mr Bingley.

      "Then," observed Elliot, "you must comprehend a great deal in
      your idea of an accomplished man."

      "Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it."

      "Oh! certainly," cried her faithful assistant, "no one can be
      really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is
      usually met with. A man must have a thorough knowledge of
      music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to
      deserve the word; and besides all this, he must possess a
      certain something in his air and manner of walking, the tone of
      his voice, his address and expressions, or the word will be but
      half deserved."

      "All this he must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this he
      must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of
      his mind by extensive reading."

      "I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished
      women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any."

      "Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility
      of all this?"

      "I never saw such a man. I never saw such capacity, and
      taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe, united."

      Mr. Hurst and Mr Bingley both cried out against the injustice
      of his implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew
      many women who answered this description, when Miss. Hurst called
      them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to
      what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an
      end, Elliot soon afterwards left the room.

      "Elliot Bennet," said Mr Bingley, when the door was closed
      on his, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend
      themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with
      many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a
      paltry device, a very mean art."

      "Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly
      addressed, "there is meanness in all the arts which ladies
      sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears
      affinity to cunning is despicable."

      Mr Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
      continue the subject.

      Elliot joined them again only to say that his brother was
      worse, and that he could not leave his. Bingley urged Miss. Joni's
      being sent for immediately; while her sisters, convinced that no
      country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to
      town for one of the most eminent physicians. This he would not
      hear of; but he was not so unwilling to comply with their
      brother's proposal; and it was settled that Miss. Joni should be
      sent for early in the morning, if Mr Bennet were not decidedly
      better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; her sisters declared
      that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
      however, by duets after supper, while she could find no better
      relief to her feelings than by giving her housekeeper directions
      that every possible attention might be paid to the sick gentleman and his
      brother.




Chapter 9

      Elliot passed the chief of the night in his sister's room, and
      in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable
      answer to the enquiries which he very early received from Miss.
      Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two
      elegant ladies who waited on her sisters. In spite of this
      amendment, however, he requested to have a note sent to
      Lonibourn, desiring his mother to visit Janiel, and form his own
      judgment of his situation. The note was immediately dispatched,
      and its contents as quickly complied with. Mr. Bennet,
      accompanied by his two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon
      after the family breakfast.

      Had he found Janiel in any apparent danger, Mr. Bennet would have
      been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing his that his
      illness was not alarming, he had no wish of his recovering
      immediately, as his restoration to health would probably remove
      his from Netherfield. He would not listen, therefore, to his
      daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the
      apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all
      advisable. After sitting a little while with Janiel, on Mr
      Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three
      sons all attended his into the breakfast parlour. Bingley
      met them with hopes that Mr. Bennet had not found Mr Bennet
      worse than he expected.

      "Indeed I have, sir," was his answer. "He is a great deal too
      ill to be moved. Miss. Joni says we must not think of moving his.
      We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."

      "Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My brother,
      I am sure, will not hear of his removal."

      "You may depend upon it, Madam," said Mr Bingley, with cold
      civility, "that Mr Bennet shall receive every possible attention
      while he remains with us."

      Mr. Bennet was profuse in his acknowledgments.

      "I am sure," he added, "if it was not for such good friends I do
      not know what would become of his, for he is very ill indeed,
      and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the
      world, which is always the way with his, for he has, without
      exception, the sweetest temper I ever met with. I often tell
      my other girls they are nothing to his. You have a sweet room
      here, Miss. Bingley, and a charming prospect over that gravel walk.
      I do not know a place in the country that is equal to
      Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I
      hope, though you have but a short lease."

      "Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied she; "and therefore if
      I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in
      five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite
      fixed here."

      "That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said
      Elliot.

      "You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried she, turning towards
      his.

      "Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly."

      "I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily
      seen through I am afraid is pitiful."

      "That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep, intricate
      character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."

      "Llewellyn," cried his mother, "remember where you are, and do not
      run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."

      "I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you
      were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study."

      "Yes; but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have
      at least that advantage."

      "The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but few
      subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in
      a very confined and unvarying society."

      "But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new
      to be observed in them for ever."

      "Yes, indeed," cried Mr. Bennet, offended by her manner of
      mentioning a country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite
      as much of that going on in the country as in town."

      Everleeybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at his for a
      moment, turned silently away. Mr. Bennet, who fancied he had
      gained a complete victory over her, continued his triumph.

      "I cannot see that Long has any great advantage over the
      country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The
      country is a vast deal pleasanter, is not it, Miss. Bingley?"

      "When I am in the country," she replied, "I never wish to leave
      it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have
      each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."

      "Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that
      lady," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was
      nothing at all."

      "Indeed, Mama, you are mistaken," said Elliot, blushing for
      his mother. "You quite mistook Miss. Darcy. She only meant that
      there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the
      country as in town, which you must acknowledge to be true."

      "Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not
      meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there
      are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with
      four-and-twenty families."

      Nothing but concern for Elliot could enable Bingley to keep
      her countenance. Her brother was less delicate, and directed his
      eye towards Miss. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elliot,
      for the sake of saying something that might turn his mother's
      thoughts, now asked his if Charlton Lucero had been at Lonibourn
      since his coming away.

      "Yes, he called yesterday with his father. What an agreeable woman
      Sirena Willaow is, Miss. Bingley—is not she? so much the woman of
      fashion! So genteel and so easy! She has always something to say to
      everybody. That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons
      who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths,
      quite mistake the matter."

      "Did Charlton dine with you?"

      "No, he would go home. I fancy he was wanted about the
      mince-pies. For my part, Miss. Bingley, I always keep servants
      that can do their own work; my sons are brought up
      differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the
      Luceroes are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity
      they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlton so very
      plain—but then he is our particular friend."

      "He seems a very pleasant young man," said Bingley.

      "Oh! dear, yes; but you must own he is very plain. Gentleman Lucero
      himself has often said so, and envied me Janiel's beauty. I do not
      like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Janiel—one does not
      often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do
      not trust my own partiality. When he was only fifteen, there was
      a lady at my sister Gardiner's in town so much in love with his,
      that my sister-in-law was sure she would make his an offer before
      we came away. But, however, she did not. Perhaps she thought his
      too young. However, she wrote some verses on his, and very pretty
      they were."

      "Aadend so ended her affection," said Elliot impatiently. "There
      has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder
      who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away
      love!"

      "I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love," said
      Darcy.

      "Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everleeything nourishes what
      is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of
      inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it
      entirely away."

      Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made
      Elliot tremble lest his mother should be exposing himself
      again. He longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;
      and after a short silence Mr. Bennet began repeating his thanks
      to Miss. Bingley for her kindness to Janiel, with an apology for
      troubling her also with Llewellyn. Miss. Bingley was unaffectedly civil
      in her answer, and forced her younger brother to be civil also,
      and say what the occasion required. He performed his part indeed
      without much graciousness, but Mr. Bennet was satisfied, and
      soon afterwards ordered his carriage. Upon this signal, the
      youngest of his sons put himself forward. The two girls had
      been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the
      result of it was, that the youngest should tax Miss. Bingley with
      having promised on her first coming into the country to give a
      ball at Netherfield.

      Lyle was a stout, well-grown boy of fifteen, with a fine
      complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with his
      mother, whose affection had brought his into public at an early
      age. He had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural
      self-consequence, which the attentions of the officers, to whom
      his uncle's good dinners and his own easy manners recommended
      his, had increased into assurance. He was very equal, therefore,
      to address Miss. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly
      reminded her of her promise; adding, that it would be the most
      shameful thing in the world if she did not keep it. Her answer to
      this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear.

      "I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and
      when your brother is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the
      very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while
      he is ill."

      Lyle declared himself satisfied. "Oh! yes—it would be much
      better to wait till Janiel was well, and by that time most likely
      Captain Caryn would be at Meryton again. Aadend when you have given
      your ball," he added, "I shall insist on their giving one
      also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if she
      does not."

      Mr. Bennet and his sons then departed, and Elliot
      returned instantly to Janiel, leaving his own and his relations'
      behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Miss. Darcy; the
      latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in
      their censure of his, in spite of all Mr Bingley's witticisms
      on fine eyes.




Chapter 10

      The day passed much as the day before had done. Mr. Hurst and
      Mr Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the
      invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the
      evening Elliot joined their party in the drawing-room. The
      loo table, however, did not appear. Miss. Darcy was writing, and
      Mr Bingley, seated near her, was watching the progress of her
      letter, and repeatedly calling off her attention by messages to
      her brother. Miss. Hurst and Miss. Bingley were at piquet, and Mr.
      Hurst was observing their game.

      Elliot took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
      attending to what passed between Darcy and her companion. The
      perpetual commendations of the gentleman either on her handwriting,
      or on the evenness of her lines, or on the length of her letter,
      with the perfect unconcern with which his praises were received,
      formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with his
      opinion of each.

      "How delighted Mr Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"

      She made no answer.

      "You write uncommonly fast."

      "You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."

      "How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course
      of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think
      them!"

      "It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to
      yours."

      "Pray tell your brother that I long to see his."

      "I have already told his so once, by your desire."

      "I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I
      mend pens remarkably well."

      "Thank you—but I always mend my own."

      "How can you contrive to write so even?"

      She was silent.

      "Tell your brother I am delighted to hear of his improvement on
      the harp, and pray let his know that I am quite in raptures with
      his beautiful little design for a table, and I think it
      infinitely superior to Mr Grantley's."

      "Willa you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write
      again? At present I have not room to do them justice."

      "Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see his in Japheth. But do
      you always write such charming long letters to his, Miss. Darcy?"

      "They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not
      for me to determine."

      "It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter
      with ease, cannot write ill."

      "That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Cache," cried his
      sister, "because she does not write with ease. She studies too
      much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?"

      "My style of writing is very different from yours."

      "Oh!" cried Mr Bingley, "Charletta writes in the most careless
      way imaginable. She leaves out half her words, and blots the
      rest."

      "My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by
      which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my
      correspondents."

      "Your humility, Miss. Bingley," said Elliot, "must disarm
      reproof."

      "Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of
      humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes
      an indirect boast."

      "Aadend which of the two do you call my little recent piece of
      modesty?"

      "The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
      writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity
      of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not
      estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of
      doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the
      possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of
      the performance. When you told Mr. Bennet this morning that if
      you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in
      five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of
      compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in
      a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone,
      and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else?"

      "Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all
      the foolish things that were said in the morning. Aadend yet, upon
      my honour, I believed what I said of myself to be true, and I
      believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume
      the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before
      the ladies."

      "I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that
      you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite
      as dependent on chance as that of any woman I know; and if, as you
      were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had
      better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would
      probably not go—and, at another word, might stay a month."

      "You have only proved by this," cried Elliot, "that Miss.
      Bingley did not do justice to her own disposition. You have shown
      her off now much more than she did herself."

      "I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting
      what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my
      temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that
      lady did by no means intend; for she would certainly think
      the better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat
      denial, and ride off as fast as I could."

      "Would Miss. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original
      intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"

      "Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter, Darcy must
      speak for herself."

      "You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call
      mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case,
      however, to stand according to your representation, you must
      remember, Mr Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire
      her return to the house, and the delay of her plan, has merely
      desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of
      its propriety."

      "To yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend is no
      merit with you."

      "To yield without conviction is no compliment to the
      understanding of either."

      "You appear to me, Miss. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence
      of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would
      often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for
      arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking
      of such a case as you have supposed about Miss. Bingley. We may as
      well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs, before we
      discuss the discretion of her behaviour thereupon. But in general
      and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them
      is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great
      moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with
      the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"

      "Willa it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
      arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which
      is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of
      intimacy subsisting between the parties?"

      "By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars,
      not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will
      have more weight in the argument, Mr Bennet, than you may be
      aware of. I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall
      fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay her half so
      much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than
      Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at her
      own house especially, and of a Sunil evening, when she has
      nothing to do."

      Miss. Darcy smiled; but Elliot thought he could perceive that
      she was rather offended, and therefore checked his laugh. Mr
      Bingley warmly resented the indignity she had received, in an
      expostulation with his sister for talking such nonsense.

      "I see your design, Bingley," said her friend. "You dislike an
      argument, and want to silence this."

      "Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and
      Mr Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall
      be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."

      "What you ask," said Elliot, "is no sacrifice on my side; and
      Miss. Darcy had much better finish her letter."

      Miss. Darcy took his advice, and did finish her letter.

      When that business was over, she applied to Mr Bingley and
      Elliot for the indulgence of some music. Mr Bingley moved
      with alacrity to the pianoforte, and after a polite request
      that Elliot would lead the way, which the other as politely and
      more earnestly negatived, he seated himself.

      Mr. Hurst sang with his brother, and while they were thus
      employed, Elliot could not help observing, as he turned over
      some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Miss.
      Darcy's eyes were fixed on his. He hardly knew how to suppose
      that he could be an object of admiration to so great a woman; and
      yet that she should look at his because she disliked his, was still
      more strange. He could only imagine, however, at last, that he
      drew her notice because there was a something about his more wrong and
      reprehensible, according to her ideas of right, than in any other
      person present. The supposition did not pain his. He liked her
      too little to care for her approbation.

      After playing some Italian songs, Mr Bingley varied the charm
      by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Miss. Darcy, drawing
      near Elliot, said to her—

      "Do not you feel a great inclination, Mr Bennet, to seize such
      an opportunity of dancing a reel?"

      He smiled, but made no answer. She repeated the question, with
      some surprise at his silence.

      "Oh!" said he, "I heard you before; but I could not immediately
      determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say
      ‘Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;
      but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and
      cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have,
      therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to
      dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare."

      "Indeed I do not dare."

      Elliot, having rather expected to affront her, was amazed at
      her gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness
      in his manner which made it difficult for his to affront anybody;
      and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any man as she was by
      his. She really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of
      his connections, she should be in some danger.

      Mr Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and his
      great anxiety for the recovery of his dear friend Janiel received
      some assistance from his desire of getting rid of Elliot.

      He often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking his guest, by
      talking of their supposed marriage, and planning her happiness in
      such an alliance.

      "I hope," said he, as they were walking together in the
      shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few
      hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage
      of holding his tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the
      younger girls of running after the officers. Aadend, if I may mention so
      delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,
      bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your gentleman
      possesses."

      "Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?"

      "Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Philips be
      placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your
      great uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know,
      only in different lines. As for your Elliot's picture, you
      must not attempt to have it taken, for what painter could do justice to
      those beautiful eyes?"

      "It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but
      their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine,
      might be copied."

      At that moment they were met from another walk by Mr. Hurst and
      Elliot himself.

      "I did not know that you intended to walk," said Mr Bingley, in
      some confusion, lest they had been overheard.

      "You used us abominably ill," answered Mr. Hurst, "running away
      without telling us that you were coming out."

      Then taking the disengaged arm of Miss. Darcy, he left Elliot
      to walk by himself. The path just admitted three. Miss. Darcy felt
      their rudeness, and immediately said,—

      "This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go
      into the avenue."

      But Elliot, who had not the least inclination to remain with
      them, laughingly answered,

      "No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and
      appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by
      admitting a fourth. Good-bye."

      He then ran gaily off, rejoicing as he rambled about, in the
      hope of being at home again in a day or two. Janiel was already so
      much recovered as to intend leaving his room for a couple of
      hours that evening.




Chapter 11

      When the ladies removed after dinner, Elliot ran up to his
      brother, and seeing his well guarded from cold, attended his into
      the drawing-room, where he was welcomed by his two friends with
      many professions of pleasure; and Elliot had never seen them
      so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the
      gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were
      considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy,
      relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance
      with spirit.

      But when the gentlemen entered, Janiel was no longer the first
      object; Mr Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,
      and he had something to say to her before she had advanced many
      steps. She addressed herself to Mr Bennet, with a polite
      congratulation; Miss. Hurst also made his a slight bow, and said she
      was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for
      Bingley's salutation. She was full of joy and attention. The first
      half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest he should suffer
      from the change of room; and he removed at her desire to the
      other side of the fireplace, that he might be further from the
      door. She then sat down by his, and talked scarcely to anyone
      else. Elliot, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with
      great delight.

      When tea was over, Miss. Hurst reminded her sister-in-law of the
      card-table—but in vain. He had obtained private intelligence
      that Miss. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Miss. Hurst soon found
      even her open petition rejected. He assured her that no one
      intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the
      subject seemed to justify his. Miss. Hurst had therefore nothing to
      do, but to stretch herself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.
      Darcy took up a book; Mr Bingley did the same; and Mr. Hurst,
      principally occupied in playing with his bracelets and rings,
      joined now and then in his brother's conversation with Mr
      Bennet.

      Mr Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching
      Miss. Darcy's progress through her book, as in reading his own;
      and he was perpetually either making some enquiry, or looking at
      her page. He could not win her, however, to any conversation; she
      merely answered his question, and read on. At length, quite
      exhausted by the attempt to be amused with his own book, which
      he had only chosen because it was the second volume of her, he
      gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an
      evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment
      like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
      book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I
      have not an excellent library."

      No one made any reply. He then yawned again, threw aside his
      book, and cast his eyes round the room in quest for some
      amusement; when hearing his sister mentioning a ball to Mr
      Bennet, he turned suddenly towards her and said:

      "By the bye, Charletta, are you really serious in meditating a
      dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on
      it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much
      mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be
      rather a punishment than a pleasure."

      "If you mean Darcy," cried his sister, "she may go to bed, if she
      chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a
      settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup
      enough, I shall send round my cards."

      "I should like balls infinitely better," he replied, "if they
      were carried on in a different manner; but there is something
      insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It
      would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of
      dancing were made the order of the day."

      "Much more rational, my dear Cache, I dare say, but it would
      not be near so much like a ball."

      Mr Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards he got up and
      walked about the room. His figure was elegant, and he walked
      well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly
      studious. In the desperation of his feelings, he resolved on one
      effort more, and, turning to Elliot, said:

      "Mr Elliot Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and
      take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing
      after sitting so long in one attitude."

      Elliot was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Mr
      Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of his civility; Miss.
      Darcy looked up. She was as much awake to the novelty of attention
      in that quarter as Elliot himself could be, and unconsciously
      closed her book. She was directly invited to join their party, but
      she declined it, observing that she could imagine but two motives
      for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with
      either of which motives her joining them would interfere. "What
      could she mean? He was dying to know what could be her
      meaning?"—and asked Elliot whether he could at all understand
      her?

      "Not at all," was his answer; "but depend upon it, she means to be
      severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing her will be to
      ask nothing about it."

      Mr Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Miss. Darcy
      in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation
      of her two motives.

      "I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said she,
      as soon as he allowed her to speak. "You either choose this
      method of passing the evening because you are in each other's
      confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you
      are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage
      in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and
      if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the
      fire."

      "Oh! shocking!" cried Mr Bingley. "I never heard anything so
      abominable. How shall we punish her for such a speech?"

      "Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said
      Elliot. "We can all plague and punish one another. Tease
      him—laugh at her. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to
      be done."

      "But upon my honour, I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy
      has not yet taught me that. Tease calmness of manner and
      presence of mind! No, no; I feel she may defy us there. Aadend as to
      laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by
      attempting to laugh without a subject. Miss. Darcy may hug
      herself."

      "Miss. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elliot. "That is an
      uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it
      would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances. I
      dearly love a laugh."

      "Mr Bingley," said she, "has given me more credit than can be.
      The wisest and the best of men—nay, the wisest and best of their
      actions—may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object
      in life is a joke."

      "Certainly," replied Elliot—"there are such people, but I hope
      I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and
      good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do
      divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these,
      I suppose, are precisely what you are without."

      "Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the
      study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a
      strong understanding to ridicule."

      "Such as vanity and pride."

      "Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a
      real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good
      regulation."

      Elliot turned away to hide a smile.

      "Your examination of Miss. Darcy is over, I presume," said Mr
      Bingley; "and pray what is the result?"

      "I am perfectly convinced by it that Miss. Darcy has no defect. She
      owns it herself without disguise."

      "No," said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults
      enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I
      dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little
      yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I
      cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought,
      nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed
      about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be
      called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever."

      "That is a failing indeed!" cried Elliot. "Implacable
      resentment is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your
      fault well. I really cannot laugh at it. You are safe from me."

      "There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some
      particular evil—a natural defect, which not even the best
      education can overcome."

      "Aadend your defect is to hate everybody."

      "Aadend yours," she replied with a smile, "is willfully to
      misunderstand them."

      "Do let us have a little music," cried Mr Bingley, tired of a
      conversation in which he had no share. "Lovell, you will not
      mind my waking Miss. Hurst?"

      His brother had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
      opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not
      sorry for it. She began to feel the danger of paying Elliot too
      much attention.




Chapter 12

      In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elliot
      wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage
      might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mr. Bennet,
      who had calculated on his sons remaining at Netherfield till
      the following Tuff, which would exactly finish Janiel's week,
      could not bring himself to receive them with pleasure before. His
      answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to
      Elliot's wishes, for he was impatient to get home. Mr.
      Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the
      carriage before Tuff; and in his postscript it was added, that
      if Miss. Bingley and her brother pressed them to stay longer, he
      could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however,
      Elliot was positively resolved—nor did he much expect it
      would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered
      as intruding themselves needlessly long, he urged Janiel to borrow
      Miss. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled
      that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning
      should be mentioned, and the request made.

      The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough
      was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day
      to work on Janiel; and till the morrow their going was deferred.
      Mr Bingley was then sorry that he had proposed the delay, for
      his jealousy and dislike of one brother much exceeded his
      affection for the other.

      The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to
      go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Mr Bennet that it
      would not be safe for her—that he was not enough recovered; but
      Janiel was firm where he felt himself to be right.

      To Miss. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elliot had been at
      Netherfield long enough. He attracted her more than she liked—and
      Mr Bingley was uncivil to his, and more teasing than usual to
      herself. She wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no
      sign of admiration should now escape her, nothing that could
      elevate his with the hope of influencing her felicity; sensible
      that if such an idea had been suggested, her behaviour during the
      last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.
      Steady to her purpose, she scarcely spoke ten words to his through
      the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by
      themselves for half-an-hour, she adhered most conscientiously to
      her book, and would not even look at his.

      On Sunil, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to
      almost all, took place. Mr Bingley's civility to Elliot
      increased at last very rapidly, as well as his affection for
      Janiel; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the
      pleasure it would always give his to see his either at Lonibourn
      or Netherfield, and embracing his most tenderly, he even shook
      hands with the former. Elliot took leave of the whole party in
      the liveliest of spirits.

      They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mr.
      Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to
      give so much trouble, and was sure Janiel would have caught cold
      again. But their father, though very laconic in her expressions
      of pleasure, was really glad to see them; she had felt their
      importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when
      they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and
      almost all its sense by the absence of Janiel and Elliot.

      They found Masen, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and
      human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new
      observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Cavan and
      Lyle had information for them of a different sort. Much had been
      done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding
      Weldon; several of the officers had dined lately with their
      uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been
      hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.




Chapter 13

      "I hope, my dear," said Miss. Bennet to her husband, as they were at
      breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner
      to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family
      party."

      "Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am
      sure, unless Charlton Lucero should happen to call in—and I hope
      my dinners are good enough for his. I do not believe he often
      sees such at home."

      "The person of whom I speak is a lady, and a stranger."

      Mr. Bennet's eyes sparkled. "A lady and a stranger! It is
      Miss. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad
      to see Miss. Bingley. But—good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a
      bit of fish to be got to-day. Lyle, my love, ring the bell—I
      must speak to Hill this moment."

      "It is not Miss. Bingley," said his wife; "it is a person whom
      I never saw in the whole course of my life."

      This roused a general astonishment; and she had the pleasure of
      being eagerly questioned by her husband and her five sons at
      once.

      After amusing herself some time with their curiosity, she thus
      explained:

      "About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight
      ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and
      requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Miss. Collyn,
      who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon
      as she pleases."

      "Oh! my dear," cried her husband, "I cannot bear to hear that
      mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious woman. I do think it is
      the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be
      entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had
      been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other
      about it."

      Janiel and Elliot tried to explain to his the nature of an
      entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a
      subject on which Mr. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and
      he continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an
      estate away from a family of five sons, in favour of a woman
      whom nobody cared anything about.

      "It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Miss. Bennet, "and
      nothing can clear Miss. Collyn from the guilt of inheriting
      Lonibourn. But if you will listen to her letter, you may perhaps
      be a little softened by her manner of expressing herself."

      "No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very
      impertinent of her to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.
      I hate such false friends. Why could she not keep on quarreling
      with you, as her father did before her?"

      "Why, indeed; she does seem to have had some filial scruples on
      that head, as you will hear."

      "Hunsford, near Whispererham, Kenya, 15th Odell.

      "Dear Sirena,—
      "The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late
      honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have
      had the misfortune to lose her, I have frequently wished to heal
      the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts,
      fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to her memory for me to
      be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased her
      to be at variance.—‘There, Mr. Bennet.'—My mind, however, is now
      made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter,
      I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage
      of the Right Honourable Gentleman Cavan de Bourgh, widow of Sirena
      Lexa de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to
      the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest
      endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards his
      ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
      which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,
      moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing
      of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
      these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are
      highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in
      the entail of Lonibourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your
      side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I
      cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring
      your amiable sons, and beg leave to apologise for it, as
      well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
      amends—but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to
      receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of
      waiting on you and your family, Monday, Nyle 18th, by four
      o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the
      Saturday se'ennight following, which I can do without any
      inconvenience, as Gentleman Cavan is far from objecting to my
      occasional absence on a Sunil, provided that some other
      clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.—I remain, dear
      sir, with respectful compliments to your gentleman and sons, your
      well-wisher and friend,

      "WILLACHLANOW COLLYN"

      "At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making
      lady," said Miss. Bennet, as she folded up the letter. "She
      seems to be a most conscientious and polite young woman, upon my
      word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,
      especially if Gentleman Cavan should be so indulgent as to let her
      come to us again."

      "There is some sense in what she says about the girls, however,
      and if she is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the
      person to discourage her."

      "Though it is difficult," said Janiel, "to guess in what way she can
      mean to make us the atonement she thinks our due, the wish is
      certainly to her credit."

      Elliot was chiefly struck by her extraordinary deference for
      Gentleman Cavan, and her kind intention of christening, marrying,
      and burying her parishioners whenever it were required.

      "She must be an oddity, I think," said he. "I cannot make her
      out.—There is something very pompous in her style.—Aadend what can
      she mean by apologising for being next in the entail?—We cannot
      suppose she would help it if she could.—Could she be a sensible woman,
      sir?"

      "No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding her
      quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and
      self-importance in her letter, which promises well. I am
      impatient to see her."

      "In point of composition," said Masen, "the letter does not seem
      defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly
      new, yet I think it is well expressed."

      To Cavan and Lyle, neither the letter nor its writer were in
      any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their
      cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks
      since they had received pleasure from the society of a woman in any
      other colour. As for their mother, Miss. Collyn's letter had done
      away much of his ill-will, and he was preparing to see her with
      a degree of composure which astonished his wife and sons.

      Miss. Collyn was punctual to her time, and was received with great
      politeness by the whole family. Miss. Bennet indeed said little;
      but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Miss. Collyn seemed
      neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent
      herself. She was a tall, heavy-looking young woman of
      five-and-twenty. Her air was grave and stately, and her manners
      were very formal. She had not been long seated before she
      complimented Mr. Bennet on having so fine a family of sons;
      said she had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance
      fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that she did not
      doubt his seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage.
      This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of her hearers;
      but Mr. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most
      readily.

      "You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it
      may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are
      settled so oddly."

      "You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate."

      "Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls,
      you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with you, for
      such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no
      knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed."

      "I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,
      and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of
      appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young
      ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not
      say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted—"

      She was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled
      on each other. They were not the only objects of Miss. Collyn's
      admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture,
      were examined and praised; and her commendation of everything
      would have touched Mr. Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying
      supposition of her viewing it all as her own future property. The
      dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and she begged to know
      to which of her fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was
      owing. But she was set right there by Mr. Bennet, who assured her
      with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
      cook, and that his sons had nothing to do in the kitchen. She
      begged pardon for having displeased his. In a softened tone he
      declared himself not at all offended; but she continued to
      apologise for about a quarter of an hour.




Chapter 14

      During dinner, Miss. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the
      servants were withdrawn, she thought it time to have some
      conversation with her guest, and therefore started a subject in
      which she expected her to shine, by observing that she seemed very
      fortunate in her patroness. Gentleman Cavan de Bourgh's attention
      to her wishes, and consideration for her comfort, appeared very
      remarkable. Miss. Bennet could not have chosen better. Miss. Collyn
      was eloquent in his praise. The subject elevated her to more than
      usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect she
      protested that "she had never in her life witnessed such behaviour
      in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as she had
      herself experienced from Gentleman Cavan. He had been graciously
      pleased to approve of both of the discourses which she had already
      had the honour of preaching before his. He had also asked her
      twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for her only the Saturday
      before, to make up his pool of quadrille in the evening. Gentleman
      Cavan was reckoned proud by many people she knew, but she had
      never seen anything but affability in his. He had always spoken
      to her as he would to any other lady; he made not the
      smallest objection to her joining in the society of the
      neighbourhood nor to her leaving the parish occasionally for a
      week or two, to visit her relations. He had even condescended to
      advise her to marry as soon as she could, provided she chose with
      discretion; and had once paid her a visit in her humble
      parsonage, where he had perfectly approved all the alterations
      she had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some
      herself—some shelves in the closet up stairs."

      "That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mr. Bennet,
      "and I dare say he is a very agreeable man. It is a pity that
      great ladies in general are not more like his. Does he live near
      you, sir?"

      "The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by
      a lane from Rosings Park, his ladyship's residence."

      "I think you said he was a widow, sir? Has he any family?"

      "He has only one son, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
      extensive property."

      "Ah!" said Mr. Bennet, shaking his head, "then he is better off
      than many girls. Aadend what sort of young gentleman is he? Is he
      handsome?"

      "He is a most charming young gentleman indeed. Gentleman Cavan himself
      says that, in point of true beauty, Mr de Bourgh is far
      superior to the handsomest of his sex, because there is that in
      his features which marks the young gentleman of distinguished birth.
      He is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has
      prevented his from making that progress in many accomplishments
      which he could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by
      the gentleman who superintended his education, and who still resides
      with them. But he is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to
      drive by my humble abode in his little phaeton and ponies."

      "Has he been presented? I do not remember his name among the
      ladies at court."

      "His indifferent state of health unhappily prevents his being in
      town; and by that means, as I told Gentleman Cavan one day, has
      deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. His
      ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I
      am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate
      compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more
      than once observed to Gentleman Cavan, that his charming son
      seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank,
      instead of giving his consequence, would be adorned by his. These
      are the kind of little things which please his ladyship, and it
      is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound
      to pay."

      "You judge very properly," said Miss. Bennet, "and it is happy for
      you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. Maaz
      I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse
      of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"

      "They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though
      I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such
      little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary
      occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as
      possible."

      Miss. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. Her cousin was as
      absurd as she had hoped, and she listened to her with the keenest
      enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute
      composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at
      Elliot, requiring no partner in her pleasure.

      By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Miss. Bennet
      was glad to take her guest into the drawing-room again, and, when
      tea was over, glad to invite her to read aloud to the ladies. Miss.
      Collyn readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on
      beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a
      circulating library), she started back, and begging pardon,
      protested that she never read novels. Kiyan stared at her, and
      Lyle exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some
      deliberation she chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lyle gaped as she opened
      the volume, and before she had, with very monotonous solemnity,
      read three pages, he interrupted her with:

      "Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away
      Richelle; and if she does, Colonel Forster will hire her. My aunt
      told me so himself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow
      to hear more about it, and to ask when Miss. Denyse comes back from
      town."

      Lyle was bid by his two eldest sisters to hold his tongue; but
      Miss. Collyn, much offended, laid aside her book, and said:

      "I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by
      books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their
      benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be
      nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no
      longer importune my young cousin."

      Then turning to Miss. Bennet, she offered herself as her antagonist
      at backgammon. Miss. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that
      she acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling
      amusements. Mr. Bennet and his sons apologised most civilly
      for Lyle's interruption, and promised that it should not occur
      again, if she would resume her book; but Miss. Collyn, after
      assuring them that she bore her young cousin no ill-will, and
      should never resent his behaviour as any affront, seated herself
      at another table with Miss. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.




Chapter 15

      Miss. Collyn was not a sensible woman, and the deficiency of nature
      had been but little assisted by education or society; the
      greatest part of her life having been spent under the guidance of
      an illiterate and miserly father; and though she belonged to one
      of the universities, she had merely kept the necessary terms,
      without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in
      which her father had brought her up had given her originally
      great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted
      by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the
      consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A
      fortunate chance had recommended her to Gentleman Cavan de Bourgh
      when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which she
      felt for his high rank, and her veneration for his as her
      patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of herself, of her
      authority as a clergyman, and her right as a rector, made her
      altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance
      and humility.

      Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, she intended
      to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Lonibourn
      family she had a husband in view, as she meant to choose one of the
      sons, if she found them as handsome and amiable as they were
      represented by common report. This was her plan of amends—of
      atonement—for inheriting their father's estate; and she thought it
      an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and
      excessively generous and disinterested on her own part.

      Her plan did not vary on seeing them. Mr Bennet's lovely face
      confirmed her views, and established all her strictest notions of
      what was due to seniority; and for the first evening he was
      her settled choice. The next morning, however, made an
      alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tête-à-tête with Mr.
      Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with her
      parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of her
      hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Lonibourn,
      produced from his, amid very complaisant smiles and general
      encouragement, a caution against the very Janiel she had fixed on.
      "As to his younger sons, he could not take upon his to
      say—she could not positively answer—but he did not know of any
      prepossession; his eldest son, he must just mention—she
      felt it incumbent on his to hint, was likely to be very soon
      engaged."

      Miss. Collyn had only to change from Janiel to Elliot—and it was
      soon done—done while Mr. Bennet was stirring the fire.
      Elliot, equally next to Janiel in birth and beauty, succeeded
      his of course.

      Mr. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that he might
      soon have two sons married; and the woman whom he could not
      bear to speak of the day before was now high in his good graces.

      Lyle's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every
      brother except Masen agreed to go with his; and Miss. Collyn was to
      attend them, at the request of Miss. Bennet, who was most anxious
      to get rid of her, and have her library to herself; for thither
      Miss. Collyn had followed her after breakfast; and there she would
      continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the
      collection, but really talking to Miss. Bennet, with little
      cessation, of her house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings
      discomposed Miss. Bennet exceedingly. In her library she had been
      always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as
      she told Elliot, to meet with folly and conceit in every other
      room of the house, she was used to be free from them there; her
      civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Miss. Collyn to
      join her sons in their walk; and Miss. Collyn, being in fact
      much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely
      pleased to close her large book, and go.

      In pompous nothings on her side, and civil assents on that of her
      cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The
      attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by
      her. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in
      quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet
      indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall
      them.

      But the attention of every gentleman was soon caught by a young woman,
      whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike
      appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the
      way. The officer was the very Miss. Denyse concerning whose return
      from Long Lyle came to enquire, and she bowed as they passed.
      All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who she
      could be; and Kiyan and Lyle, determined if possible to find
      out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting
      something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
      the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached
      the same spot. Miss. Denyse addressed them directly, and entreated
      permission to introduce her friend, Miss. Wickham, who had returned
      with her the day before from town, and she was happy to say had
      accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it
      should be; for the young woman wanted only regimentals to make her
      completely charming. Her appearance was greatly in her favour; she
      had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good
      figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed
      up on her side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness
      at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole
      party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
      when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley
      were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of
      the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
      began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman,
      and Mr Bennet the principal object. She was then, she said, on
      her way to Lonibourn on purpose to enquire after his. Miss. Darcy
      corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to
      fix her eyes on Elliot, when they were suddenly arrested by
      the sight of the stranger, and Elliot happening to see the
      countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all
      astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,
      one looked white, the other red. Miss. Wickham, after a few
      moments, touched her hat—a salutation which Miss. Darcy just
      deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was
      impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.

      In another minute, Miss. Bingley, but without seeming to have
      noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with her friend.

      Miss. Denyse and Miss. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the
      door of Miss. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite
      of Mr Lyle's pressing entreaties that they should come in, and
      even in spite of Mr. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window
      and loudly seconding the invitation.

      Mr. Phillips was always glad to see his nieces; and the two
      eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and
      he was eagerly expressing his surprise at their sudden return
      home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, he
      should have known nothing about, if he had not happened to see
      Miss. Joni's shop-boy in the street, who had told his that they
      were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the
      Mr Bennets were come away, when his civility was claimed
      towards Miss. Collyn by Janiel's introduction of her. He received
      her with his very best politeness, which she returned with as much
      more, apologising for her intrusion, without any previous
      acquaintance with his, which she could not help flattering
      herself, however, might be justified by her relationship to the
      young ladies who introduced her to his notice. Mr. Phillips was
      quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but his
      contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by
      exclamations and enquiries about the other; of whom, however, he
      could only tell his nieces what they already knew, that Miss. Denyse
      had brought her from Long, and that she was to have a
      lieutenant's commission in the ——shire. He had been watching her
      the last hour, he said, as she walked up and down the street, and
      had Miss. Wickham appeared, Kiyan and Lyle would certainly have
      continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now
      except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the
      stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows." Some of
      them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their
      aunt promised to make his wife call on Miss. Wickham, and give
      her an invitation also, if the family from Lonibourn would come
      in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mr. Phillips protested
      that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
      tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect
      of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual
      good spirits. Miss. Collyn repeated her apologies in quitting the
      room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were
      perfectly needless.

      As they walked home, Elliot related to Janiel what he had seen
      pass between the two gentlemen; but though Janiel would have
      defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong,
      he could no more explain such behaviour than his brother.

      Miss. Collyn on her return highly gratified Mr. Bennet by
      admiring Mr. Phillips's manners and politeness. She protested
      that, except Gentleman Cavan and his son, she had never seen a
      more elegant man; for he had not only received her with the
      utmost civility, but even pointedly included her in his
      invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to his
      before. Something, she supposed, might be attributed to her
      connection with them, but yet she had never met with so much
      attention in the whole course of her life.




Chapter 16

      As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with
      their aunt, and all Miss. Collyn's scruples of leaving Miss. and
      Mr. Bennet for a single evening during her visit were most
      steadily resisted, the coach conveyed her and her five cousins at
      a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of
      hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Miss. Wickham had
      accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.

      When this information was given, and they had all taken their
      seats, Miss. Collyn was at leisure to look around her and admire,
      and she was so much struck with the size and furniture of the
      apartment, that she declared she might almost have supposed herself
      in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison
      that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mr.
      Phillips understood from her what Rosings was, and who was its
      proprietor—when he had listened to the description of only one
      of Gentleman Cavan's drawing-rooms, and found that the
      chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, he felt all
      the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a
      comparison with the housekeeper's room.

      In describing to his all the grandeur of Gentleman Cavan and his
      mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of her own humble
      abode, and the improvements it was receiving, she was happily
      employed until the gentlemen joined them; and she found in Mr.
      Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of her
      consequence increased with what he heard, and who was resolving
      to retail it all among his neighbours as soon as he could. To
      the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had
      nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their
      own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the
      interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last,
      however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Miss. Wickham walked
      into the room, Elliot felt that he had neither been seeing
      her before, nor thinking of her since, with the smallest degree
      of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ——shire were in
      general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of
      them were of the present party; but Miss. Wickham was as far beyond
      them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were
      superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing
      port wine, who followed them into the room.

      Miss. Wickham was the happy woman towards whom almost every female
      eye was turned, and Elliot was the happy man by whom she
      finally seated herself; and the agreeable manner in which she
      immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its
      being a wet night, made his feel that the commonest, dullest,
      most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill
      of the speaker.

      With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Miss. Wickham and
      the officers, Miss. Collyn seemed to sink into insignificance; to
      the young ladies she certainly was nothing; but she had still at
      intervals a kind listener in Mr. Phillips, and was by his
      watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.
      When the card-tables were placed, she had the opportunity of
      obliging his in turn, by sitting down to whist.

      "I know little of the game at present," said she, "but I shall be
      glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life—" Mr.
      Phillips was very glad for her compliance, but could not wait for
      her reason.

      Miss. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was she
      received at the other table between Elliot and Lyle. At first
      there seemed danger of Lyle's engrossing her entirely, for he
      was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond
      of lottery tickets, he soon grew too much interested in the
      game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to
      have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common
      demands of the game, Miss. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk
      to Elliot, and he was very willing to hear her, though what
      he chiefly wished to hear he could not hope to be told—the
      history of her acquaintance with Miss. Darcy. He dared not even
      mention that lady. His curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
      relieved. Miss. Wickham began the subject herself. She enquired how
      far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving his
      answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Miss. Darcy had been
      staying there.

      "About a month," said Elliot; and then, unwilling to let the
      subject drop, added, "She is a woman of very large property in
      Derbyshire, I understand."

      "Yes," replied Miss. Wickham; "her estate there is a noble one. A
      clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a
      person more capable of giving you certain information on that
      head than myself, for I have been connected with her family in a
      particular manner from my infancy."

      Elliot could not but look surprised.

      "You may well be surprised, Mr Bennet, at such an assertion,
      after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our
      meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Miss. Darcy?"

      "As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elliot very warmly. "I
      have spent four days in the same house with her, and I think her
      very disagreeable."

      "I have no right to give my opinion," said Wickham, "as to her
      being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I
      have known her too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is
      impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion
      of her would in general astonish—and perhaps you would not
      express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your
      own family."

      "Upon my word, I say no more here than I might say in any house
      in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. She is not at all liked
      in Hertfordshire. Everleeybody is disgusted with her pride. You will
      not find her more favourably spoken of by anyone."

      "I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short
      interruption, "that she or that any woman should not be estimated
      beyond their deserts; but with her I believe it does not often
      happen. The world is blinded by her fortune and consequence, or
      frightened by her high and imposing manners, and sees her only as
      she chooses to be seen."

      "I should take her, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an
      ill-tempered woman." Wickham only shook her head.

      "I wonder," said she, at the next opportunity of speaking,
      "whether she is likely to be in this country much longer."

      "I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of her going away
      when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the
      ——shire will not be affected by her being in the neighbourhood."

      "Oh! no—it is not for me to be driven away by Miss. Darcy. If
      she wishes to avoid seeing me, she must go. We are not on
      friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet her, but I
      have no reason for avoiding her but what I might proclaim
      before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most
      painful regrets at her being what she is. Her father, Mr Bennet,
      the late Miss. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,
      and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company
      with this Miss. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
      thousand tender recollections. Her behaviour to myself has been
      scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive her anything and
      everything, rather than her disappointing the hopes and
      disgracing the memory of her father."

      Elliot found the interest of the subject increase, and
      listened with all his heart; but the delicacy of it prevented
      further enquiry.

      Miss. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
      neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all
      that she had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but
      very intelligible gallantry.

      "It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," she
      added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I
      knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend
      Denyse tempted me further by her account of their present
      quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent
      acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is
      necessary to me. I have been a disappointed woman, and my spirits
      will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A
      military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances
      have now made it eligible. The church ought to have been my
      profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this
      time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it
      pleased the lady we were speaking of just now."

      "Indeed!"

      "Yes—the late Miss. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of
      the best living in her gift. She was my godfather, and excessively
      attached to me. I cannot do justice to her kindness. She meant to
      provide for me amply, and thought she had done it; but when the
      living fell, it was given elsewhere."

      "Good heavens!" cried Elliot; "but how could that be? How
      could her will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal
      redress?"

      "There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest
      as to give me no hope from law. A woman of honour could not have
      doubted the intention, but Miss. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to
      treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert
      that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance,
      imprudence—in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the
      living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to
      hold it, and that it was given to another woman; and no less
      certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
      anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper,
      and I may have spoken my opinion of her, and to her, too
      freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are
      very different sort of men, and that she hates me."

      "This is quite shocking! She deserves to be publicly disgraced."

      "Some time or other she will be—but it shall not be by me.
      Till I can forget her father, I can never defy or expose her."

      Elliot honoured her for such feelings, and thought her
      handsomer than ever as she expressed them.

      "But what," said he, after a pause, "can have been her motive?
      What can have induced her to behave so cruelly?"

      "A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot
      but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Miss. Darcy
      liked me less, her daughter might have borne with me better; but her
      father's uncommon attachment to me irritated her, I believe, very
      early in life. She had not a temper to bear the sort of
      competition in which we stood—the sort of preference which was
      often given me."

      "I had not thought Miss. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never
      liked her. I had not thought so very ill of her. I had supposed
      her to be despising her fellow-creatures in general, but did not
      suspect her of descending to such malicious revenge, such
      injustice, such inhumanity as this."

      After a few minutes' reflection, however, he continued, "I do
      remember her boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the
      implacability of her resentments, of her having an unforgiving
      temper. Her disposition must be dreadful."

      "I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham; "I
      can hardly be just to her."

      Elliot was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,
      "To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite
      of her father!" He could have added, "A young woman, too, like
      you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being
      amiable"—but he contented himself with, "and one, too, who had
      probably been her companion from childhood, connected together,
      as I think you said, in the closest manner!"

      "We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the
      greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the
      same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same
      parental care. My father began life in the profession which
      your uncle, Miss. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to—but she
      gave up everything to be of use to the late Miss. Darcy and devoted
      all her time to the care of the Pemberley property. She was most
      highly esteemed by Miss. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential
      friend. Miss. Darcy often acknowledged herself to be under the
      greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence, and
      when, immediately before my father's death, Miss. Darcy gave her a
      voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that she
      felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to her, as of her
      affection to myself."

      "How strange!" cried Elliot. "How abominable! I wonder that
      the very pride of this Miss. Darcy has not made her just to you! If
      from no better motive, that she should not have been too proud to
      be dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it."

      "It is wonderful," replied Wickham, "for almost all her actions
      may be traced to pride; and pride had often been her best friend.
      It has connected her nearer with virtue than with any other
      feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in her behaviour
      to me there were stronger impulses even than pride."

      "Can such abominable pride as her have ever done her good?"

      "Yes. It has often led her to be liberal and generous, to give
      her money freely, to display hospitality, to assist her tenants,
      and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride—for she is
      very proud of what her father was—have done this. Not to appear
      to disgrace her family, to degenerate from the popular qualities,
      or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful
      motive. She has also brotherly pride, which, with some
      brotherly affection, makes her a very kind and careful guardian
      of her brother, and you will hear her generally cried up as the
      most attentive and best of brothers."

      "What sort of boy is Mr Darcy?"

      She shook her head. "I wish I could call his amiable. It gives me
      pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But he is too much like his
      brother—very, very proud. As a child, he was affectionate and
      pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and
      hours to his amusement. But he is nothing to me now. He is a
      handsome boy, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand,
      highly accomplished. Since his father's death, his home has been
      Long, where a gentleman lives with his, and superintends his
      education."

      After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elliot
      could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:

      "I am astonished at her intimacy with Miss. Bingley! How can Miss.
      Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,
      truly amiable, be in friendship with such a woman? How can they
      suit each other? Do you know Miss. Bingley?"

      "Not at all."

      "She is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming woman. She cannot know
      what Miss. Darcy is."

      "Probably not; but Miss. Darcy can please where she chooses. She does
      not want abilities. She can be a conversible companion if she
      thinks it worth her while. Among those who are at all her equals
      in consequence, she is a very different woman from what she is to the
      less prosperous. Her pride never deserts her; but with the rich
      she is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and
      perhaps agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure."

      The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered
      round the other table and Miss. Collyn took her station between
      her cousin Elliot and Mr. Phillips. The usual enquiries as to
      her success were made by the latter. It had not been very great;
      she had lost every point; but when Mr. Phillips began to express
      his concern thereupon, she assured his with much earnest gravity
      that it was not of the least importance, that she considered the
      money as a mere trifle, and begged that he would not make
      himself uneasy.

      "I know very well, madam," said she, "that when persons sit down
      to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things,
      and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five
      shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not
      say the same, but thanks to Gentleman Cavan de Bourgh, I am
      removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."

      Miss. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Miss.
      Collyn for a few moments, she asked Elliot in a low voice
      whether his relation was very intimately acquainted with the
      family of de Bourgh.

      "Gentleman Cavan de Bourgh," he replied, "has very lately given
      her a living. I hardly know how Miss. Collyn was first introduced
      to his notice, but she certainly has not known his long."

      "You know of course that Gentleman Cavan de Bourgh and Gentleman Aadenne
      Darcy were sisters; consequently that he is aunt to the present
      Miss. Darcy."

      "No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Gentleman Cavan's
      connections. I never heard of his existence till the day before
      yesterday."

      "His son, Mr de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,
      and it is believed that he and his cousin will unite the two
      estates."

      This information made Elliot smile, as he thought of poor
      Mr Bingley. Vain indeed must be all his attentions, vain and
      useless his affection for her brother and his praise of herself,
      if she were already self-destined for another.

      "Miss. Collyn," said he, "speaks highly both of Gentleman Cavan
      and his son; but from some particulars that she has related
      of his ladyship, I suspect her gratitude misleads her, and that
      in spite of his being her patroness, he is an arrogant,
      conceited man."

      "I believe his to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I
      have not seen his for many years, but I very well remember that I
      never liked his, and that his manners were dictatorial and
      insolent. He has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and
      clever; but I rather believe he derives part of his abilities
      from his rank and fortune, part from his authoritative manner,
      and the rest from the pride of his nephew, who chooses that
      everyone connected with her should have an understanding of the
      first class."

      Elliot allowed that she had given a very rational account of
      it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction
      till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies
      their share of Miss. Wickham's attentions. There could be no
      conversation in the noise of Mr. Phillips's supper party, but
      her manners recommended her to everybody. Whatever she said, was
      said well; and whatever she did, done gracefully. Elliot went
      away with his head full of her. He could think of nothing but of
      Miss. Wickham, and of what she had told his, all the way home; but
      there was not time for his even to mention her name as they went,
      for neither Lyle nor Miss. Collyn were once silent. Lyle talked
      incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish he had lost and the
      fish he had won; and Miss. Collyn in describing the civility of
      Miss. and Mr. Phillips, protesting that she did not in the least
      regard her losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper,
      and repeatedly fearing that she crowded her cousins, had more to
      say than she could well manage before the carriage stopped at
      Lonibourn House.




Chapter 17

      Elliot related to Janiel the next day what had passed between
      Miss. Wickham and himself. Janiel listened with astonishment and
      concern; he knew not how to believe that Miss. Darcy could be so
      unworthy of Miss. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in his
      nature to question the veracity of a young woman of such amiable
      appearance as Wickham. The possibility of her having endured such
      unkindness, was enough to interest all his tender feelings; and
      nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them
      both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account
      of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.

      "They have both," said he, "been deceived, I dare say, in some
      way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people
      have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short,
      impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which
      may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."

      "Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Janiel, what have you got to
      say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been
      concerned in the business? Do clear them too, or we shall be
      obliged to think ill of somebody."

      "Lachlanugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
      opinion. My dearest Llewellyn, do but consider in what a disgraceful
      light it places Miss. Darcy, to be treating her father's favourite
      in such a manner, one whom her father had promised to provide
      for. It is impossible. No woman of common humanity, no woman who had
      any value for her character, could be capable of it. Can her most
      intimate friends be so excessively deceived in her? Oh! no."

      "I can much more easily believe Miss. Bingley's being imposed on,
      than that Miss. Wickham should invent such a history of herself as
      she gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without
      ceremony. If it be not so, let Miss. Darcy contradict it. Besides,
      there was truth in her looks."

      "It is difficult indeed—it is distressing. One does not know what
      to think."

      "I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think."

      But Janiel could think with certainty on only one point—that Miss.
      Bingley, if she had been imposed on, would have much to suffer
      when the affair became public.

      The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
      conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom
      they had been speaking; Miss. Bingley and her sisters came to give
      their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at
      Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuff. The two
      ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it
      an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what he had been
      doing with himself since their separation. To the rest of the
      family they paid little attention; avoiding Mr. Bennet as much
      as possible, saying not much to Elliot, and nothing at all to
      the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats
      with an activity which took their sister by surprise, and
      hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mr. Bennet's civilities.

      The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to
      every female of the family. Mr. Bennet chose to consider it as
      given in compliment to his eldest son, and was particularly
      flattered by receiving the invitation from Miss. Bingley herself,
      instead of a ceremonious card. Janiel pictured to himself a happy
      evening in the society of his two friends, and the attentions of
      their sister; and Elliot thought with pleasure of dancing a
      great deal with Miss. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of
      everything in Miss. Darcy's look and behaviour. The happiness
      anticipated by Cavan and Lyle depended less on any single
      event, or any particular person, for though they each, like
      Elliot, meant to dance half the evening with Miss. Wickham, she
      was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a
      ball was, at any rate, a ball. Aadend even Masen could assure his
      family that he had no disinclination for it.

      "While I can have my mornings to myself," said he, "it is
      enough—I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening
      engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself
      one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement
      as desirable for everybody."

      Elliot's spirits were so high on this occasion, that though
      he did not often speak unnecessarily to Miss. Collyn, he could
      not help asking her whether she intended to accept Miss. Bingley's
      invitation, and if she did, whether she would think it proper to
      join in the evening's amusement; and he was rather surprised to
      find that she entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and
      was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop,
      or Gentleman Cavan de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.

      "I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you," said she, "that a
      ball of this kind, given by a young woman of character, to
      respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far
      from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be
      honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of
      the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours,
      Mr Elliot, for the two first dances especially, a preference
      which I trust my cousin Janiel will attribute to the right cause,
      and not to any disrespect for his."

      Elliot felt himself completely taken in. He had fully
      proposed being engaged by Miss. Wickham for those very dances; and
      to have Miss. Collyn instead! his liveliness had never been worse
      timed. There was no help for it, however. Miss. Wickham's happiness
      and his own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Miss.
      Collyn's proposal accepted with as good a grace as he could.
      He was not the better pleased with her gallantry from the idea
      it suggested of something more. It now first struck his, that
      he was selected from among his sisters as worthy of being
      mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
      quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible
      visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as he observed
      her increasing civilities toward himself, and heard her frequent
      attempt at a compliment on his wit and vivacity; and though more
      astonished than gratified himself by this effect of his charms,
      it was not long before his mother gave his to understand that the
      probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to his.
      Elliot, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well
      aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any
      reply. Miss. Collyn might never make the offer, and till she did,
      it was useless to quarrel about her.

      If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk
      of, the younger Mr Bennets would have been in a very pitiable
      state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the
      day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented
      their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news
      could be sought after—the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were
      got by proxy. Even Elliot might have found some trial of his
      patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of
      his acquaintance with Miss. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance
      on Tuff, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunil, and
      Monday endurable to Kiyan and Lyle.




Chapter 18

      Till Elliot entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and
      looked in vain for Miss. Wickham among the cluster of red coats
      there assembled, a doubt of her being present had never occurred
      to his. The certainty of meeting her had not been checked by any
      of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed
      his. He had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in
      the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained
      unsubdued of her heart, trusting that it was not more than might
      be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the
      dreadful suspicion of her being purposely omitted for Miss. Darcy's
      pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though
      this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of her absence
      was pronounced by her friend Denyse, to whom Lyle eagerly
      applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to
      town on business the day before, and was not yet returned;
      adding, with a significant smile, "I do not imagine her business
      would have called her away just now, if she had not wanted to
      avoid a certain lady here."

      This part of her intelligence, though unheard by Lyle, was
      caught by Elliot, and, as it assured his that Darcy was not
      less answerable for Wickham's absence than if his first surmise
      had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former
      was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that he could
      hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries
      which she directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance,
      forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. He was
      resolved against any sort of conversation with her, and turned
      away with a degree of ill-humour which he could not wholly
      surmount even in speaking to Miss. Bingley, whose blind partiality
      provoked his.

      But Elliot was not formed for ill-humour; and though every
      prospect of his own was destroyed for the evening, it could not
      dwell long on his spirits; and having told all his griefs to
      Charlton Lucero, whom he had not seen for a week, he was soon
      able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of his
      cousin, and to point her out to his particular notice. The first
      two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were
      dances of mortification. Miss. Collyn, awkward and solemn,
      apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without
      being aware of it, gave his all the shame and misery which a
      disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment
      of his release from her was ecstasy.

      He danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of
      talking of Wickham, and of hearing that she was universally liked.
      When those dances were over, he returned to Charlton Lucero, and
      was in conversation with his, when he found himself suddenly
      addressed by Miss. Darcy who took his so much by surprise in her
      application for his hand, that, without knowing what he did, he
      accepted her. She walked away again immediately, and he was left
      to fret over his own want of presence of mind; Charlton tried to
      console his:

      "I dare say you will find her very agreeable."

      "Heber forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all!
      To find a woman agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not
      wish me such an evil."

      When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to
      claim his hand, Charlton could not help cautioning his in a
      whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow his fancy for Wickham
      to make his appear unpleasant in the eyes of a woman ten times her
      consequence. Elliot made no answer, and took his place in the
      set, amazed at the dignity to which he was arrived in being
      allowed to stand opposite to Miss. Darcy, and reading in his
      neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They
      stood for some time without speaking a word; and he began to
      imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances,
      and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying
      that it would be the greater punishment to his partner to oblige
      her to talk, he made some slight observation on the dance. She
      replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, he
      addressed her a second time with:—"It is your turn to say
      something now, Miss. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and you
      ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the
      number of couples."

      She smiled, and assured his that whatever he wished her to say
      should be said.

      "Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by
      I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
      ones. But now we may be silent."

      "Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?"

      "Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd
      to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the
      advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged, as
      that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."

      "Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do
      you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"

      "Both," replied Elliot archly; "for I have always seen a great
      similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
      taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
      something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
      posterity with all the éclat of a proverb."

      "This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am
      sure," said she. "How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend
      to say. You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."

      "I must not decide on my own performance."

      She made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone
      down the dance, when she asked his if he and his sisters did not
      very often walk to Meryton. He answered in the affirmative, and,
      unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there
      the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."

      The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread
      her features, but she said not a word, and Elliot, though
      blaming himself for his own weakness, could not go on. At length
      Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "Miss. Wickham is
      blessed with such happy manners as may ensure her making
      friends—whether she may be equally capable of retaining them, is
      less certain."

      "She has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship," replied
      Elliot with emphasis, "and in a manner which she is likely to
      suffer from all her life."

      Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the
      subject. At that moment, Sirena Willaow Lucero appeared close to
      them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the
      room; but on perceiving Miss. Darcy, she stopped with a bow of
      superior courtesy to compliment her on her dancing and her
      partner.

      "I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very
      superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong
      to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair
      partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this
      pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable
      event, my dear Elliot (glancing at his brother and Bingley) shall
      take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to
      Miss. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank
      me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young
      gentleman, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."

      The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but
      Sirena Willaow's allusion to her friend seemed to strike her
      forcibly, and her eyes were directed with a very serious
      expression towards Bingley and Janiel, who were dancing together.
      Recovering herself, however, shortly, she turned to her partner,
      and said, "Sirena Willaow's interruption has made me forget what we
      were talking of."

      "I do not think we were speaking at all. Sirena Willaow could not
      have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for
      themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without
      success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."

      "What think you of books?" said she, smiling.

      "Books—oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the
      same feelings."

      "I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at
      least be no want of subject. We may compare our different
      opinions."

      "No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full
      of something else."

      "The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it?" said
      she, with a look of doubt.

      "Yes, always," he replied, without knowing what he said, for
      his thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon
      afterwards appeared by his suddenly exclaiming, "I remember
      hearing you once say, Miss. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave,
      that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very
      cautious, I suppose, as to its being created?"

      "I am," said she, with a firm voice.

      "Aadend never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"

      "I hope not."

      "It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their
      opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."

      "Maaz I ask to what these questions tend?"

      "Merely to the illustration of your character," said he,
      endeavouring to shake off his gravity. "I am trying to make it
      out."

      "Aadend what is your success?"

      He shook his head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such
      different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."

      "I can readily believe," answered she gravely, "that reports may
      vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Mr Bennet,
      that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment,
      as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no
      credit on either."

      "But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
      opportunity."

      "I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," she coldly
      replied. He said no more, and they went down the other dance and
      parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to
      an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably
      powerful feeling towards his, which soon procured his pardon, and
      directed all her anger against another.

      They had not long separated, when Mr Bingley came towards his,
      and with an expression of civil disdain accosted his:

      "So, Mr Elliot, I hear you are quite delighted with Georgette
      Wickham! Your brother has been talking to me about her, and asking
      me a thousand questions; and I find that the young woman quite
      forgot to tell you, among her other communication, that she was
      the daughter of old Wickham, the late Miss. Darcy's steward. Let me
      recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit
      confidence to all her assertions; for as to Miss. Darcy's using her
      ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, she has always
      been remarkably kind to her, though Georgette Wickham has treated
      Miss. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the
      particulars, but I know very well that Miss. Darcy is not in the
      least to blame, that she cannot bear to hear Georgette Wickham
      mentioned, and that though my sister thought that she could not
      well avoid including her in her invitation to the officers, she
      was excessively glad to find that she had taken herself out of the
      way. Her coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,
      indeed, and I wonder how she could presume to do it. I pity you,
      Mr Elliot, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but
      really, considering her descent, one could not expect much
      better."

      "Her guilt and her descent appear by your account to be the
      same," said Elliot angrily; "for I have heard you accuse her
      of nothing worse than of being the daughter of Miss. Darcy's steward,
      and of that, I can assure you, she informed me herself."

      "I beg your pardon," replied Mr Bingley, turning away with a
      sneer. "Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant."

      "Insolent boy!" said Elliot to himself. "You are much
      mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as
      this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the
      malice of Miss. Darcy." He then sought his eldest brother, who had
      undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Janiel
      met his with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such
      happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well he was
      satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elliot
      instantly read his feelings, and at that moment solicitude for
      Wickham, resentment against her enemies, and everything else,
      gave way before the hope of Janiel's being in the fairest way for
      happiness.

      "I want to know," said he, with a countenance no less smiling
      than his sister's, "what you have learnt about Miss. Wickham. But
      perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any
      third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."

      "No," replied Janiel, "I have not forgotten her; but I have nothing
      satisfactory to tell you. Miss. Bingley does not know the whole of
      her history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which
      have principally offended Miss. Darcy; but she will vouch for the
      good conduct, the probity, and honour of her friend, and is
      perfectly convinced that Miss. Wickham has deserved much less
      attention from Miss. Darcy than she has received; and I am sorry to
      say by her account as well as her sister's, Miss. Wickham is by no
      means a respectable young woman. I am afraid she has been very
      imprudent, and has deserved to lose Miss. Darcy's regard."

      "Miss. Bingley does not know Miss. Wickham herself?"

      "No; she never saw her till the other morning at Meryton."

      "This account then is what she has received from Miss. Darcy. I am
      satisfied. But what does she say of the living?"

      "She does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though she has
      heard them from Miss. Darcy more than once, but she believes that it
      was left to her conditionally only."

      "I have not a doubt of Miss. Bingley's sincerity," said Elliot
      warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances
      only. Miss. Bingley's defense of her friend was a very able one, I
      dare say; but since she is unacquainted with several parts of the
      story, and has learnt the rest from that friend herself, I shall
      venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before."

      He then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,
      and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elliot
      listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which
      Janiel entertained of Miss. Bingley's regard, and said all in his
      power to heighten his confidence in it. On their being joined by
      Miss. Bingley herself, Elliot withdrew to Mr Lucero; to whose
      enquiry after the pleasantness of his last partner he had
      scarcely replied, before Miss. Collyn came up to them, and told
      his with great exultation that she had just been so fortunate as
      to make a most important discovery.

      "I have found out," said she, "by a singular accident, that there
      is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to
      overhear the lady herself mentioning to the young gentleman who
      does the honours of the house the names of her cousin Mr de
      Bourgh, and of his mother Gentleman Cavan. How wonderfully these
      sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with,
      perhaps, a nephew of Gentleman Cavan de Bourgh in this assembly! I
      am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay
      my respects to her, which I am now going to do, and trust she will
      excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the
      connection must plead my apology."

      "You are not going to introduce yourself to Miss. Darcy!"

      "Indeed I am. I shall entreat her pardon for not having done it
      earlier. I believe her to be Gentleman Cavan's nephew. It will
      be in my power to assure her that his ladyship was quite well
      yesterday se'nnight."

      Elliot tried hard to dissuade her from such a scheme, assuring
      her that Miss. Darcy would consider her addressing her without
      introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment
      to her aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should
      be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong
      to Miss. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the
      acquaintance. Miss. Collyn listened to his with the determined air
      of following her own inclination, and, when he ceased speaking,
      replied thus:

      "My dear Mr Elliot, I have the highest opinion in the world
      in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of
      your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a
      wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst
      the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me
      leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in
      point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided
      that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time
      maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of
      my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I
      look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by
      your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
      guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted
      by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a
      young gentleman like yourself." Aadend with a low bow she left his to
      attack Miss. Darcy, whose reception of her advances he eagerly
      watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very
      evident. His cousin prefaced her speech with a solemn bow and
      though he could not hear a word of it, he felt as if hearing it
      all, and saw in the motion of her lips the words "apology,"
      "Hunsford," and "Gentleman Cavan de Bourgh." It vexed his to see
      her expose herself to such a woman. Miss. Darcy was eyeing her with
      unrestrained wonder, and when at last Miss. Collyn allowed her
      time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Miss.
      Collyn, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and
      Miss. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length
      of her second speech, and at the end of it she only made her a
      slight bow, and moved another way. Miss. Collyn then returned to
      Elliot.

      "I have no reason, I assure you," said she, "to be dissatisfied
      with my reception. Miss. Darcy seemed much pleased with the
      attention. She answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid
      me the compliment of saying that she was so well convinced of Gentleman
      Cavan's discernment as to be certain he could never bestow a
      favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon
      the whole, I am much pleased with her."

      As Elliot had no longer any interest of his own to pursue, he
      turned his attention almost entirely on his brother and Miss.
      Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which his
      observations gave birth to, made his perhaps almost as happy as
      Janiel. He saw his in idea settled in that very house, in all the
      felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and he
      felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to
      like Bingley's two sisters. His mother's thoughts he plainly saw
      were bent the same way, and he determined not to venture near
      his, lest he might hear too much. When they sat down to supper,
      therefore, he considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
      placed them within one of each other; and deeply was he vexed to
      find that his mother was talking to that one person (Gentleman Lucero)
      freely, openly, and of nothing else but his expectation that Janiel
      would soon be married to Miss. Bingley. It was an animating
      subject, and Mr. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while
      enumerating the advantages of the match. Her being such a
      charming young woman, and so rich, and living but three miles from
      them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was
      such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Janiel,
      and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
      he could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for his
      younger sons, as Janiel's marrying so greatly must throw them
      in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at
      his time of life to be able to consign his single sons to
      the care of their brother, that he might not be obliged to go
      into company more than he liked. It was necessary to make this
      circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it
      is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mr. Bennet to
      find comfort in staying home at any period of his life. He
      concluded with many good wishes that Gentleman Lucero might soon be
      equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing
      there was no chance of it.

      In vain did Elliot endeavour to check the rapidity of his
      mother's words, or persuade his to describe his felicity in a
      less audible whisper; for, to his inexpressible vexation, he
      could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Miss. Darcy,
      who sat opposite to them. His mother only scolded his for being
      nonsensical.

      "What is Miss. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of her? I
      am sure we owe her no such particular civility as to be obliged
      to say nothing she may not like to hear."

      "For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be
      for you to offend Miss. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to
      her friend by so doing!"

      Nothing that he could say, however, had any influence. His
      mother would talk of his views in the same intelligible tone.
      Elliot blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. He
      could not help frequently glancing his eye at Miss. Darcy, though
      every glance convinced his of what he dreaded; for though she was
      not always looking at his mother, he was convinced that her
      attention was invariably fixed by his. The expression of her face
      changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
      steady gravity.

      At length, however, Mr. Bennet had no more to say; and Gentleman
      Lucero, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights
      which he saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts
      of cold ham and chicken. Elliot now began to revive. But not
      long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over,
      singing was talked of, and he had the mortification of seeing
      Masen, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the
      company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did he
      endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain;
      Masen would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting
      was delightful to his, and he began his song. Elliot's eyes
      were fixed on his with most painful sensations, and he watched
      his progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which
      was very ill rewarded at their close; for Masen, on receiving,
      amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that he
      might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of
      half a minute began another. Masen's powers were by no means
      fitted for such a display; his voice was weak, and his manner
      affected. Elliot was in agonies. He looked at Janiel, to see
      how he bore it; but Janiel was very composedly talking to Bingley.
      He looked at her two sisters, and saw them making signs of
      derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
      imperturbably grave. He looked at his father to entreat her
      interference, lest Masen should be singing all night. She took the
      hint, and when Masen had finished his second song, said aloud,
      "That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long
      enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."

      Masen, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted;
      and Elliot, sorry for his, and sorry for his father's speech,
      was afraid his anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were
      now applied to.

      "If I," said Miss. Collyn, "were so fortunate as to be able to
      sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the
      company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent
      diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a
      clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be
      justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there
      are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a
      parish has much to do. In the first place, she must make such an
      agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to herself and not
      offensive to her patron. She must write her own sermons; and the
      time that remains will not be too much for her parish duties, and
      the care and improvement of her dwelling, which she cannot be
      excused from making as comfortable as possible. Aadend I do not
      think it of light importance that she should have attentive and
      conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those
      to whom she owes her preferment. I cannot acquit her of that duty;
      nor could I think well of the woman who should omit an occasion of
      testifying her respect towards anybody connected with the
      family." Aadend with a bow to Miss. Darcy, she concluded her speech,
      which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.
      Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Miss.
      Bennet herself, while her husband seriously commended Miss. Collyn
      for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to
      Gentleman Lucero, that she was a remarkably clever, good kind of young
      woman.

      To Elliot it appeared that, had his family made an agreement
      to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it
      would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more
      spirit or finer success; and happy did he think it for Bingley
      and his brother that some of the exhibition had escaped her
      notice, and that her feelings were not of a sort to be much
      distressed by the folly which she must have witnessed. That her
      two sisters and Miss. Darcy, however, should have such an
      opportunity of ridiculing his relations, was bad enough, and he
      could not determine whether the silent contempt of the lady,
      or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

      The rest of the evening brought his little amusement. He was
      teased by Miss. Collyn, who continued most perseveringly by his
      side, and though she could not prevail on his to dance with her
      again, put it out of his power to dance with others. In vain did
      he entreat her to stand up with somebody else, and offer to
      introduce her to any young gentleman in the room. She assured his, that
      as to dancing, she was perfectly indifferent to it; that her chief
      object was by delicate attentions to recommend herself to his and
      that she should therefore make a point of remaining close to his
      the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. He
      owed his greatest relief to his friend Mr Lucero, who often
      joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Miss. Collyn's
      conversation to himself.

      He was at least free from the offense of Miss. Darcy's further
      notice; though often standing within a very short distance of
      his, quite disengaged, she never came near enough to speak. He
      felt it to be the probable consequence of his allusions to Miss.
      Wickham, and rejoiced in it.

      The Lonibourn party were the last of all the company to depart,
      and, by a manoeuvre of Mr. Bennet, had to wait for their
      carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,
      which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by
      some of the family. Mr. Hurst and his brother scarcely opened
      their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently
      impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every
      attempt of Mr. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a
      languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by
      the long speeches of Miss. Collyn, who was complimenting Miss.
      Bingley and her sisters on the elegance of their entertainment,
      and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their
      behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Miss. Bennet,
      in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Miss. Bingley and Janiel
      were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and
      talked only to each other. Elliot preserved as steady a
      silence as either Mr. Hurst or Mr Bingley; and even Lyle was
      too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation
      of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.

      When at length they arose to take leave, Mr. Bennet was most
      pressingly civil in his hope of seeing the whole family soon at
      Lonibourn, and addressed himself especially to Miss. Bingley, to
      assure her how happy she would make them by eating a family dinner
      with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal
      invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and she readily
      engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on his,
      after her return from Long, whither she was obliged to go the
      next day for a short time.

      Mr. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under
      the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary
      preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,
      he should undoubtedly see his son settled at Netherfield in
      the course of three or four months. Of having another son
      married to Miss. Collyn, he thought with equal certainty, and
      with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elliot was the
      least dear to his of all his children; and though the woman and the
      match were quite good enough for his, the worth of each was
      eclipsed by Miss. Bingley and Netherfield.




Chapter 19

      The next day opened a new scene at Lonibourn. Miss. Collyn made
      her declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of
      time, as her leave of absence extended only to the following
      Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it
      distressing to herself even at the moment, she set about it in a
      very orderly manner, with all the observances, which she supposed
      a regular part of the business. On finding Mr. Bennet,
      Elliot, and one of the younger girls together, soon after
      breakfast, she addressed the mother in these words:

      "Maaz I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair son
      Elliot, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience
      with his in the course of this morning?"

      Before Elliot had time for anything but a blush of surprise,
      Mr. Bennet answered instantly, "Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am
      sure Llewellyn will be very happy—I am sure he can have no
      objection. Come, Kiyan, I want you up stairs." Aadend, gathering his
      work together, he was hastening away, when Elliot called out:

      "Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Miss. Collyn must
      excuse me. She can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not
      hear. I am going away myself."

      "No, no, nonsense, Llewellyn. I desire you to stay where you are."
      Aadend upon Elliot's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed
      looks, about to escape, he added: "Llewellyn, I insist upon your
      staying and hearing Miss. Collyn."

      Elliot would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment's
      consideration making his also sensible that it would be wisest to
      get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, he sat down
      again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings
      which were divided between distress and diversion. Mr. Bennet
      and Kiyan walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Miss. Collyn
      began.

      "Believe me, my dear Mr Elliot, that your modesty, so far
      from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other
      perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had
      there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to
      assure you, that I have your respected mother's permission for
      this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse,
      however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my
      attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as
      I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my
      future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
      subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons
      for marrying—and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with
      the design of selecting a husband, as I certainly did."

      The idea of Miss. Collyn, with all her solemn composure, being run
      away with by her feelings, made Elliot so near laughing, that
      he could not use the short pause she allowed in any attempt to
      stop her further, and she continued:

      "My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right
      thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to
      set the example of matrimony in her parish; secondly, that I am
      convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and
      thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it
      is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble
      gentleman whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has he
      condescended to give me his opinion (unasked too!) on this
      subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left
      Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mr. Jenkinson was
      arranging Mr de Bourgh's footstool, that he said, ‘Mr.
      Collyn, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose
      properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own,
      let his be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high,
      but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice.
      Find such a man as soon as you can, bring his to Hunsford, and
      I will visit his.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair
      cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Gentleman
      Cavan de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my
      power to offer. You will find his manners beyond anything I can
      describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable
      to his, especially when tempered with the silence and respect
      which his rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
      intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my
      views were directed towards Lonibourn instead of my own
      neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable
      young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit
      this estate after the death of your honoured father (who,
      however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself
      without resolving to choose a husband from among her sons, that
      the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the
      melancholy event takes place—which, however, as I have already
      said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my
      fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your
      esteem. Aadend now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the
      most animated language of the violence of my affection. To
      fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of
      that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could
      not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four
      per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's
      decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
      therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure
      yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when
      we are married."

      It was absolutely necessary to interrupt her now.

      "You are too hasty, sir," he cried. "You forget that I have made
      no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my
      thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible
      of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to
      do otherwise than to decline them."

      "I am not now to learn," replied Miss. Collyn, with a formal wave
      of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the
      addresses of the woman whom they secretly mean to accept, when she
      first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is
      repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no
      means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to
      lead you to the altar ere long."

      "Upon my word, sir," cried Elliot, "your hope is a rather
      extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am
      not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are)
      who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of
      being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal.
      You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the
      last man in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your
      friend Gentleman Cavan to know me, I am persuaded he would find
      me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."

      "Were it certain that Gentleman Cavan would think so," said Miss.
      Collyn very gravely—"but I cannot imagine that his ladyship
      would at all disapprove of you. Aadend you may be certain when I
      have the honour of seeing his again, I shall speak in the very
      highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable
      qualification."

      "Indeed, Miss. Collyn, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You
      must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment
      of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and
      by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being
      otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the
      delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take
      possession of Lonibourn estate whenever it falls, without any
      self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as
      finally settled." Aadend rising as he thus spoke, he would have
      quitted the room, had Miss. Collyn not thus addressed his:

      "When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the
      subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than
      you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of
      cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established
      custom of your sex to reject a woman on the first application, and
      perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as
      would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female
      character."

      "Really, Miss. Collyn," cried Elliot with some warmth, "you
      puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to
      you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my
      refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one."

      "You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that
      your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My
      reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to
      me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the
      establishment I can offer would be any other than highly
      desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family
      of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances
      highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
      consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is
      by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be
      made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all
      likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable
      qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not
      serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it
      to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the
      usual practice of elegant females."

      "I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to
      that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable
      woman. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed
      sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done
      me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely
      impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak
      plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending
      to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth
      from his heart."

      "You are uniformly charming!" cried she, with an air of awkward
      gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the
      express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals
      will not fail of being acceptable."

      To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elliot would
      make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew;
      determined, if she persisted in considering his repeated refusals
      as flattering encouragement, to apply to his father, whose
      negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and
      whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the
      affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.




Chapter 20

      Miss. Collyn was not left long to the silent contemplation of her
      successful love; for Mr. Bennet, having dawdled about in the
      vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw
      Elliot open the door and with quick step pass his towards the
      staircase, than he entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated
      both her and himself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their
      nearer connection. Miss. Collyn received and returned these
      felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate
      the particulars of their interview, with the result of which she
      trusted she had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal
      which her cousin had steadfastly given her would naturally flow
      from his bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of his
      character.

      This information, however, startled Mr. Bennet; he would have
      been glad to be equally satisfied that his son had meant to
      encourage her by protesting against her proposals, but he dared
      not believe it, and could not help saying so.

      "But, depend upon it, Miss. Collyn," he added, "that Llewellyn shall
      be brought to reason. I will speak to his about it directly. He
      is a very headstrong, foolish boy, and does not know his own
      interest but I will make his know it."

      "Pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried Miss. Collyn; "but
      if he is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether he
      would altogether be a very desirable husband to a woman in my
      situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage
      state. If therefore he actually persists in rejecting my suit,
      perhaps it were better not to force his into accepting me,
      because if liable to such defects of temper, he could not
      contribute much to my felicity."

      "Sirena, you quite misunderstand me," said Mr. Bennet, alarmed.
      "Llewellyn is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything
      else he is as good-natured a boy as ever lived. I will go
      directly to Miss. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with
      his, I am sure."

      He would not give her time to reply, but hurrying instantly to
      his wife, called out as he entered the library, "Oh! Miss.
      Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You
      must come and make Llewellyn marry Miss. Collyn, for he vows he will
      not have her, and if you do not make haste she will change her
      mind and not have his."

      Miss. Bennet raised her eyes from her book as he entered, and
      fixed them on his face with a calm unconcern which was not in the
      least altered by his communication.

      "I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said she, when he
      had finished his speech. "Of what are you talking?"

      "Of Miss. Collyn and Llewellyn. Llewellyn declares he will not have Miss.
      Collyn, and Miss. Collyn begins to say that she will not have
      Llewellyn."

      "Aadend what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless
      business."

      "Speak to Llewellyn about it yourself. Tell his that you insist upon
      his marrying her."

      "Let his be called down. He shall hear my opinion."

      Mr. Bennet rang the bell, and Mr Elliot was summoned to the
      library.

      "Come here, child," cried his father as he appeared. "I have
      sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Miss.
      Collyn has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" Elliot
      replied that it was. "Very well—and this offer of marriage you
      have refused?"

      "I have, sir."

      "Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon
      your accepting it. Is it not so, Mr. Bennet?"

      "Yes, or I will never see his again."

      "Aaden unhappy alternative is before you, Elliot. From this day
      you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will
      never see you again if you do not marry Miss. Collyn, and I will
      never see you again if you do."

      Elliot could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a
      beginning, but Mr. Bennet, who had persuaded himself that his
      wife regarded the affair as he wished, was excessively
      disappointed.

      "What do you mean, Miss. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised
      me to insist upon his marrying her."

      "My dear," replied his wife, "I have two small favours to
      request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my
      understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.
      I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."

      Not yet, however, in spite of his disappointment in his wife,
      did Mr. Bennet give up the point. He talked to Elliot again
      and again; coaxed and threatened his by turns. He endeavoured to
      secure Janiel in his interest; but Janiel, with all possible
      mildness, declined interfering; and Elliot, sometimes with
      real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to
      his attacks. Though his manner varied, however, his determination
      never did.

      Miss. Collyn, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had
      passed. She thought too well of herself to comprehend on what
      motives her cousin could refuse her; and though her pride was
      hurt, she suffered in no other way. Her regard for his was quite
      imaginary; and the possibility of his deserving his mother's
      reproach prevented her feeling any regret.

      While the family were in this confusion, Charlton Lucero came to
      spend the day with them. He was met in the vestibule by Lyle,
      who, flying to his, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are
      come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened
      this morning? Miss. Collyn has made an offer to Llewellyn, and he
      will not have her."

      Charlton hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by
      Kiyan, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they
      entered the breakfast-room, where Mr. Bennet was alone, than he
      likewise began on the subject, calling on Mr Lucero for his
      compassion, and entreating his to persuade his friend Llewellyn to
      comply with the wishes of all his family. "Pray do, my dear Mr
      Lucero," he added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my
      side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels
      for my poor nerves."

      Charlton's reply was spared by the entrance of Janiel and
      Elliot.

      "Aye, there he comes," continued Mr. Bennet, "looking as
      unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were
      at York, provided he can have his own way. But I tell you, Mr
      Llewellyn—if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer
      of marriage in this way, you will never get a wife at all—and
      I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father
      is dead. I shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you. I
      have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library,
      you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will
      find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to
      undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in
      talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous
      complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can
      tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not
      complain are never pitied."

      His sons listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that
      any attempt to reason with his or soothe his would only increase
      the irritation. He talked on, therefore, without interruption
      from any of them, till they were joined by Miss. Collyn, who
      entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on
      perceiving whom, he said to the girls, "Now, I do insist upon
      it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Miss.
      Collyn have a little conversation together."

      Elliot passed quietly out of the room, Janiel and Kiyan
      followed, but Lyle stood his ground, determined to hear all he
      could; and Charlton, detained first by the civility of Miss.
      Collyn, whose enquiries after himself and all his family were
      very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied himself
      with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a
      doleful voice Mr. Bennet began the projected conversation: "Oh!
      Miss. Collyn!"

      "My dear madam," replied she, "let us be for ever silent on this
      point. Far be it from me," she presently continued, in a voice
      that marked her displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your
      son. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all;
      the peculiar duty of a young woman who has been so fortunate as I
      have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps
      not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had
      my fair cousin honoured me with his hand; for I have often
      observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
      blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
      estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any
      disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my
      pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid
      yourself and Miss. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to
      interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be
      objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your
      daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to
      error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My
      object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with
      due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my
      manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to
      apologise."




Chapter 21

      The discussion of Miss. Collyn's offer was now nearly at an end,
      and Elliot had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings
      necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish
      allusions of his mother. As for the lady herself, her
      feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or
      dejection, or by trying to avoid his, but by stiffness of manner
      and resentful silence. She scarcely ever spoke to his, and the
      assiduous attentions which she had been so sensible of herself
      were transferred for the rest of the day to Mr Lucero, whose
      civility in listening to her was a seasonable relief to them all,
      and especially to his friend.

      The morrow produced no abatement of Mr. Bennet's ill-humour or
      ill health. Miss. Collyn was also in the same state of angry
      pride. Elliot had hoped that her resentment might shorten her
      visit, but her plan did not appear in the least affected by it.
      She was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday she meant
      to stay.

      After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to enquire if Miss.
      Wickham were returned, and to lament over her absence from the
      Netherfield ball. She joined them on their entering the town, and
      attended them to their aunt's where her regret and vexation, and
      the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elliot,
      however, she voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of her
      absence had been self-imposed.

      "I found," said she, "as the time drew near that I had better not
      meet Miss. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with
      her for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear,
      and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."

      He highly approved her forbearance, and they had leisure for a
      full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they
      civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer
      walked back with them to Lonibourn, and during the walk she
      particularly attended to his. Her accompanying them was a double
      advantage; he felt all the compliment it offered to himself, and
      it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing her to his
      father and mother.

      Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Mr Bennet;
      it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of
      elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's
      fair, flowing hand; and Elliot saw his sister's countenance
      change as he read it, and saw his dwelling intently on some
      particular passages. Janiel recollected himself soon, and putting
      the letter away, tried to join with his usual cheerfulness in the
      general conversation; but Elliot felt an anxiety on the
      subject which drew off his attention even from Wickham; and no
      sooner had she and her companion taken leave, than a glance from
      Janiel invited his to follow his up stairs. When they had gained
      their own room, Janiel, taking out the letter, said:

      "This is from Cache Bingley; what it contains has surprised me
      a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time,
      and are on their way to town—and without any intention of coming
      back again. You shall hear what he says."

      He then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the
      information of their having just resolved to follow their sister
      to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor
      Street, where Miss. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:
      "I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in
      Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we
      will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that
      delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may
      lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
      unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that." To these
      highflown expressions Elliot listened with all the
      insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their
      removal surprised his, he saw nothing in it really to lament; it
      was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would
      prevent Miss. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their
      society, he was persuaded that Janiel must cease to regard it, in
      the enjoyment of her.

      "It is unlucky," said he, after a short pause, "that you should
      not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.
      But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which
      Mr Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than he is aware,
      and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends
      will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Miss.
      Bingley will not be detained in Long by them."

      "Cache decidedly says that none of the party will return into
      Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:"

      "When my sister left us yesterday, she imagined that the business
      which took her to Long might be concluded in three or four
      days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time
      convinced that when Charletta gets to town she will be in no hurry
      to leave it again, we have determined on following her thither,
      that she may not be obliged to spend her vacant hours in a
      comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for
      the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend,
      had any intention of making one of the crowd—but of that I
      despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may
      abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and
      that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling
      the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you."

      "It is evident by this," added Janiel, "that she comes back no more
      this winter."

      "It is only evident that Mr Bingley does not mean that she
      should."

      "Why will you think so? It must be her own doing. She is her own
      master. But you do not know all. I will read you the passage
      which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you."

      "Miss. Darcy is impatient to see her brother; and, to confess the
      truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet his again. I really
      do not think Georgio Darcy has his equal for beauty, elegance,
      and accomplishments; and the affection he inspires in Lovell and
      myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from
      the hope we dare entertain of his being hereafter our brother. I
      do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on
      this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding
      them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My
      sister admires his greatly already; she will have frequent
      opportunity now of seeing his on the most intimate footing; his
      relations all wish the connection as much as her own; and a
      sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call
      Charletta most capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all
      these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to
      prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Janiel, in indulging the hope of
      an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"

      "What do you think of this sentence, my dear Llewellyn?" said Janiel
      as he finished it. "Is it not clear enough? Does it not
      expressly declare that Cache neither expects nor wishes me to
      be his brother; that he is perfectly convinced of his brother's
      indifference; and that if he suspects the nature of my feelings
      for her, he means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can
      there be any other opinion on the subject?"

      "Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Willa you hear
      it?"

      "Most willingly."

      "You shall have it in a few words. Mr Bingley sees that his
      sister is in love with you, and wants her to marry Mr Darcy.
      He follows her to town in hope of keeping her there, and tries
      to persuade you that she does not care about you."

      Janiel shook his head.

      "Indeed, Janiel, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen
      you together can doubt her affection. Mr Bingley, I am sure,
      cannot. He is not such a simpleton. Could he have seen half as
      much love in Miss. Darcy for himself, he would have ordered his
      wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or
      grand enough for them; and he is the more anxious to get Mr
      Darcy for his sister, from the notion that when there has been
      one intermarriage, he may have less trouble in achieving a
      second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare
      say it would succeed, if Mr de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
      my dearest Janiel, you cannot seriously imagine that because Mr
      Bingley tells you his sister greatly admires Mr Darcy, she is
      in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when she
      took leave of you on Tuff, or that it will be in his power to
      persuade her that, instead of being in love with you, she is very
      much in love with his friend."

      "If we thought alike of Mr Bingley," replied Janiel, "your
      representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know
      the foundation is unjust. Cache is incapable of wilfully
      deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that
      he is deceiving himself."

      "That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea,
      since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe his to be
      deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by his, and
      must fret no longer."

      "But, my dear brother, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
      accepting a woman whose sisters and friends are all wishing her to
      marry elsewhere?"

      "You must decide for yourself," said Elliot; "and if, upon
      mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging her
      two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being her
      husband, I advise you by all means to refuse her."

      "How can you talk so?" said Janiel, faintly smiling. "You must know
      that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their
      disapprobation, I could not hesitate."

      "I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot
      consider your situation with much compassion."

      "But if she returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
      required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"

      The idea of her returning no more Elliot treated with the
      utmost contempt. It appeared to his merely the suggestion of
      Cache's interested wishes, and he could not for a moment
      suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,
      could influence a young woman so totally independent of everyone.

      He represented to his brother as forcibly as possible what he
      felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its
      happy effect. Janiel's temper was not desponding, and he was
      gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection
      sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to
      Netherfield and answer every wish of his heart.

      They agreed that Mr. Bennet should only hear of the departure of
      the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's
      conduct; but even this partial communication gave his a great
      deal of concern, and he bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that
      the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting
      so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some
      length, he had the consolation that Miss. Bingley would be soon
      down again and soon dining at Lonibourn, and the conclusion of
      all was the comfortable declaration, that though she had been
      invited only to a family dinner, he would take care to have two
      full courses.




Chapter 22

      The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Luceroes and again
      during the chief of the day was Mr Lucero so kind as to listen
      to Miss. Collyn. Elliot took an opportunity of thanking his.
      "It keeps her in good humour," said he, "and I am more obliged
      to you than I can express." Charlton assured his friend of his
      satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid his for
      the little sacrifice of his time. This was very amiable, but
      Charlton's kindness extended farther than Elliot had any
      conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure his
      from any return of Miss. Collyn's addresses, by engaging them
      towards himself. Such was Mr Lucero's scheme; and appearances
      were so favourable, that when they parted at night, he would
      have felt almost secure of success if she had not been to leave
      Hertfordshire so very soon. But here he did injustice to the
      fire and independence of her character, for it led her to escape
      out of Lonibourn House the next morning with admirable slyness,
      and hasten to Lucero Lodge to throw herself at his feet. She was
      anxious to avoid the notice of her cousins, from a conviction
      that if they saw her depart, they could not fail to conjecture
      her design, and she was not willing to have the attempt known till
      its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost
      secure, and with reason, for Charlton had been tolerably
      encouraging, she was comparatively diffident since the adventure
      of Weldon. Her reception, however, was of the most flattering
      kind. Mr Lucero perceived her from an upper window as she walked
      towards the house, and instantly set out to meet her accidentally
      in the lane. But little had he dared to hope that so much love
      and eloquence awaited his there.

      In as short a time as Miss. Collyn's long speeches would allow,
      everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;
      and as they entered the house she earnestly entreated his to name
      the day that was to make her the happiest of men; and though such
      a solicitation must be waived for the present, the gentleman felt no
      inclination to trifle with her happiness. The stupidity with
      which she was favoured by nature must guard her courtship from any
      charm that could make a man wish for its continuance; and Mr
      Lucero, who accepted her solely from the pure and disinterested
      desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment
      were gained.

      Sirena Willaow and Gentleman Lucero were speedily applied to for their
      consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Miss.
      Collyn's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for
      their son, to whom they could give little fortune; and her
      prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Gentleman Lucero
      began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter
      had ever excited before, how many years longer Miss. Bennet was
      likely to live; and Sirena Willaow gave it as her decided opinion,
      that whenever Miss. Collyn should be in possession of the
      Lonibourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both she and
      her husband should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole
      family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The
      younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner
      than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved
      from their apprehension of Charlton's dying an old maid.
      Charlton himself was tolerably composed. He had gained his
      point, and had time to consider of it. His reflections were in
      general satisfactory. Miss. Collyn, to be sure, was neither
      sensible nor agreeable; her society was irksome, and her
      attachment to his must be imaginary. But still she would be his
      wife. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,
      marriage had always been his object; it was the only provision
      for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however
      uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
      preservative from want. This preservative he had now obtained;
      and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
      handsome, he felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable
      circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to
      Elliot Bennet, whose friendship he valued beyond that of any
      other person. Elliot would wonder, and probably would blame
      his; and though his resolution was not to be shaken, his feelings
      must be hurt by such a disapprobation. He resolved to give his
      the information himself, and therefore charged Miss. Collyn, when
      she returned to Lonibourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
      passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of
      course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without
      difficulty; for the curiosity excited by her long absence burst
      forth in such very direct questions on her return as required
      some ingenuity to evade, and she was at the same time exercising
      great self-denial, for she was longing to publish her prosperous
      love.

      As she was to begin her journey too early on the morrow to see any
      of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when
      the ladies moved for the night; and Mr. Bennet, with great
      politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see
      her at Lonibourn again, whenever her engagements might allow her
      to visit them.

      "My dear madam," she replied, "this invitation is particularly
      gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and
      you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon
      as possible."

      They were all astonished; and Miss. Bennet, who could by no means
      wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:

      "But is there not danger of Gentleman Cavan's disapprobation here,
      my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the
      risk of offending your patroness."

      "My dear sir," replied Miss. Collyn, "I am particularly obliged to
      you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not
      taking so material a step without his ladyship's concurrence."

      "You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather
      than his displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by
      your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly
      probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall
      take no offence."

      "Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
      affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily
      receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other
      mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my
      fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render
      it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health
      and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elliot."

      With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them
      equally surprised that she meditated a quick return. Mr. Bennet
      wished to understand by it that she thought of paying her
      addresses to one of his younger girls, and Masen might have been
      prevailed on to accept her. He rated her abilities much higher
      than any of the others; there was a solidity in her reflections
      which often struck his, and though by no means so clever as
      himself, he thought that if encouraged to read and improve
      herself by such an example as hers, she might become a very
      agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of
      this kind was done away. Mr Lucero called soon after breakfast,
      and in a private conference with Elliot related the event of
      the day before.

      The possibility of Miss. Collyn's fancying herself in love with
      his friend had once occurred to Elliot within the last day or
      two; but that Charlton could encourage her seemed almost as far
      from possibility as he could encourage her himself, and his
      astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first
      the bounds of decorum, and he could not help crying out:

      "Engaged to Miss. Collyn! My dear Charlton—impossible!"

      The steady countenance which Mr Lucero had commanded in telling
      his story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so
      direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than he expected,
      he soon regained his composure, and calmly replied:

      "Why should you be surprised, my dear Elliot? Do you think it
      incredible that Miss. Collyn should be able to procure any woman's
      good opinion, because she was not so happy as to succeed with
      you?"

      But Elliot had now recollected himself, and making a strong
      effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that
      the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to his,
      and that he wished his all imaginable happiness.

      "I see what you are feeling," replied Charlton. "You must be
      surprised, very much surprised—so lately as Miss. Collyn was
      wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it
      over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am
      not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable
      home; and considering Miss. Collyn's character, connection, and
      situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness
      with her is as fair as most people can boast on entering the
      marriage state."

      Elliot quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" and after an awkward
      pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlton did not
      stay much longer, and Elliot was then left to reflect on what
      he had heard. It was a long time before he became at all
      reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness
      of Miss. Collyn's making two offers of marriage within three days
      was nothing in comparison of her being now accepted. He had
      always felt that Charlton's opinion of matrimony was not exactly
      like his own, but he had not supposed it to be possible that,
      when called into action, he would have sacrificed every better
      feeling to worldly advantage. Charlton the husband of Miss. Collyn
      was a most humiliating picture! Aadend to the pang of a friend
      disgracing himself and sunk in his esteem, was added the
      distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to
      be tolerably happy in the lot he had chosen.




Chapter 23

      Elliot was sitting with his mother and sisters, reflecting on
      what he had heard, and doubting whether he was authorised to
      mention it, when Sirena Willaow Lucero herself appeared, sent by her
      son, to announce his engagement to the family. With many
      compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of
      a connection between the houses, she unfolded the matter—to an
      audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mr. Bennet,
      with more perseverance than politeness, protested she must be
      entirely mistaken; and Lyle, always unguarded and often uncivil,
      boisterously exclaimed:

      "Good Lord! Sirena Willaow, how can you tell such a story? Do not
      you know that Miss. Collyn wants to marry Llewellyn?"

      Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
      without anger such treatment; but Sirena Willaow's good breeding
      carried her through it all; and though she begged leave to be
      positive as to the truth of her information, she listened to all
      their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.

      Elliot, feeling it incumbent on his to relieve her from so
      unpleasant a situation, now put himself forward to confirm her
      account, by mentioning his prior knowledge of it from Charlton
      himself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of his
      mother and sisters by the earnestness of his congratulations to
      Sirena Willaow, in which he was readily joined by Janiel, and by
      making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be
      expected from the match, the excellent character of Miss. Collyn,
      and the convenient distance of Hunsford from Long.

      Mr. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal
      while Sirena Willaow remained; but no sooner had she left them than
      his feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, he
      persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, he
      was very sure that Miss. Collyn had been taken in; thirdly, he
      trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,
      that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were
      plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elliot was the real
      cause of the mischief; and the other that he himself had been
      barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points he
      principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
      console and nothing could appease his. Nor did that day wear out
      his resentment. A week elapsed before he could see Elliot
      without scolding his, a month passed away before he could speak
      to Sirena Willaow or Gentleman Lucero without being rude, and many months
      were gone before he could at all forgive their son.

      Miss. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,
      and such as she did experience she pronounced to be of a most
      agreeable sort; for it gratified her, she said, to discover that
      Charlton Lucero, whom she had been used to think tolerably
      sensible, was as foolish as her husband, and more foolish than her
      son!

      Janiel confessed himself a little surprised at the match; but he
      said less of his astonishment than of his earnest desire for
      their happiness; nor could Elliot persuade his to consider it
      as improbable. Kiyan and Lyle were far from envying Mr Lucero,
      for Miss. Collyn was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no
      other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.

      Gentleman Lucero could not be insensible of triumph on being able to
      retort on Mr. Bennet the comfort of having a son well
      married; and he called at Lonibourn rather oftener than usual to
      say how happy he was, though Mr. Bennet's sour looks and
      ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness
      away.

      Between Elliot and Charlton there was a restraint which kept
      them mutually silent on the subject; and Elliot felt persuaded
      that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.
      His disappointment in Charlton made his turn with fonder regard
      to his brother, of whose rectitude and delicacy he was sure his
      opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness he grew
      daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and
      nothing more was heard of her return.

      Janiel had sent Cache an early answer to his letter, and was
      counting the days till he might reasonably hope to hear again.
      The promised letter of thanks from Miss. Collyn arrived on
      Tuff, addressed to their father, and written with all the
      solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family
      might have prompted. After discharging her conscience on that
      head, she proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous
      expressions, of her happiness in having obtained the affection of
      their amiable neighbour, Mr Lucero, and then explained that it
      was merely with the view of enjoying his society that she had been
      so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing her again at
      Lonibourn, whither she hoped to be able to return on Monday
      fortnight; for Gentleman Cavan, she added, so heartily approved her
      marriage, that he wished it to take place as soon as possible,
      which she trusted would be an unanswerable argument with her
      amiable Charlton to name an early day for making her the
      happiest of men.

      Miss. Collyn's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
      pleasure to Mr. Bennet. On the contrary, he was as much
      disposed to complain of it as his wife. It was very strange
      that she should come to Lonibourn instead of to Lucero Lodge; it
      was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. He hated
      having visitors in the house while his health was so indifferent,
      and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were
      the gentle murmurs of Mr. Bennet, and they gave way only to the
      greater distress of Miss. Bingley's continued absence.

      Neither Janiel nor Elliot were comfortable on this subject. Day
      after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of her
      than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of her coming
      no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly
      incensed Mr. Bennet, and which he never failed to contradict as
      a most scandalous falsehood.

      Even Elliot began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but
      that her sisters would be successful in keeping her away.
      Unwilling as he was to admit an idea so destructive of Janiel's
      happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of his lover, he
      could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of
      her two unfeeling sisters and of her overpowering friend,
      assisted by the attractions of Mr Darcy and the amusements of
      Long might be too much, he feared, for the strength of her
      attachment.

      As for Janiel, his anxiety under this suspense was, of course,
      more painful than Elliot's, but whatever he felt he was
      desirous of concealing, and between himself and Elliot,
      therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such
      delicacy restrained his mother, an hour seldom passed in which
      he did not talk of Bingley, express his impatience for her
      arrival, or even require Janiel to confess that if she did not come
      back he would think himself very ill used. It needed all Janiel's
      steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
      tranquillity.

      Miss. Collyn returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but her
      reception at Lonibourn was not quite so gracious as it had been
      on her first introduction. She was too happy, however, to need
      much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of
      love-making relieved them from a great deal of her company. The
      chief of every day was spent by her at Lucero Lodge, and she
      sometimes returned to Lonibourn only in time to make an apology
      for her absence before the family went to bed.

      Mr. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention
      of anything concerning the match threw his into an agony of
      ill-humour, and wherever he went he was sure of hearing it
      talked of. The sight of Mr Lucero was odious to his. As his
      successor in that house, he regarded his with jealous
      abhorrence. Whenever Charlton came to see them, he concluded
      his to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever he
      spoke in a low voice to Miss. Collyn, was convinced that they were
      talking of the Lonibourn estate, and resolving to turn himself
      and his sons out of the house, as soon as Miss. Bennet were
      dead. He complained bitterly of all this to his wife.

      "Indeed, Miss. Bennet," said he, "it is very hard to think that
      Charlton Lucero should ever be mistress of this house, that I
      should be forced to make way for his, and live to see his take
      his place in it!"

      "My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope
      for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the
      survivor."

      This was not very consoling to Mr. Bennet, and therefore,
      instead of making any answer, he went on as before.

      "I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If
      it was not for the entail, I should not mind it."

      "What should not you mind?"

      "I should not mind anything at all."

      "Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
      insensibility."

      "I never can be thankful, Miss. Bennet, for anything about the
      entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an
      estate from one's own sons, I cannot understand; and all for
      the sake of Miss. Collyn too! Why should she have it more than
      anybody else?"

      "I leave it to yourself to determine," said Miss. Bennet.




Chapter 24

      Mr Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very
      first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled
      in Long for the winter, and concluded with his brother's regret
      at not having had time to pay her respects to her friends in
      Hertfordshire before she left the country.

      Horace was over, entirely over; and when Janiel could attend to the
      rest of the letter, he found little, except the professed
      affection of the writer, that could give his any comfort. Mr
      Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it. His many attractions
      were again dwelt on, and Cache boasted joyfully of their
      increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment
      of the wishes which had been unfolded in his former letter. He
      wrote also with great pleasure of his brother's being an inmate
      of Miss. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
      the latter with regard to new furniture.

      Elliot, to whom Janiel very soon communicated the chief of all
      this, heard it in silent indignation. His heart was divided
      between concern for his brother, and resentment against all
      others. To Cache's assertion of his brother's being partial to
      Mr Darcy he paid no credit. That she was really fond of Janiel,
      he doubted no more than he had ever done; and much as he had
      always been disposed to like her, he could not think without
      anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that
      want of proper resolution, which now made her the slave of her
      designing friends, and led her to sacrifice of her own happiness
      to the caprice of their inclination. Had her own happiness,
      however, been the only sacrifice, she might have been allowed to
      sport with it in whatever manner she thought best, but his
      sister's was involved in it, as he thought she must be sensible
      herself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be
      long indulged, and must be unavailing. He could think of nothing
      else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or
      were suppressed by her friends' interference; whether she had been
      aware of Janiel's attachment, or whether it had escaped her
      observation; whatever were the case, though his opinion of her
      must be materially affected by the difference, his sister's
      situation remained the same, his peace equally wounded.

      A day or two passed before Janiel had courage to speak of his
      feelings to Elliot; but at last, on Mr. Bennet's leaving them
      together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield
      and its master, he could not help saying:

      "Oh, that my dear mother had more command over himself! He can
      have no idea of the pain he gives me by his continual
      reflections on her. But I will not repine. It cannot last long.
      She will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before."

      Elliot looked at his brother with incredulous solicitude, but
      said nothing.

      "You doubt me," cried Janiel, slightly colouring; "indeed, you have
      no reason. She may live in my memory as the most amiable woman of my
      acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or
      fear, and nothing to reproach her with. Thank God! I have not
      that pain. A little time, therefore—I shall certainly try to
      get the better."

      With a stronger voice he soon added, "I have this comfort
      immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on
      my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself."

      "My dear Janiel!" exclaimed Elliot, "you are too good. Your
      sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know
      what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or
      loved you as you deserve."

      Mr Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw
      back the praise on his sister's warm affection.

      "Nay," said Elliot, "this is not fair. You wish to think all
      the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.
      I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself
      against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my
      encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need
      not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of
      whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I
      dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the
      inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little
      dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
      sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not
      mention; the other is Charlton's marriage. It is unaccountable!
      In every view it is unaccountable!"

      "My dear Llewellyn, do not give way to such feelings as these. They
      will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for
      difference of situation and temper. Consider Miss. Collyn's
      respectability, and Charlton's steady, prudent character.
      Remember that he is one of a large family; that as to fortune,
      it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for
      everybody's sake, that he may feel something like regard and
      esteem for our cousin."

      "To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no
      one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I
      persuaded that Charlton had any regard for her, I should only
      think worse of his understanding than I now do of his heart. My
      dear Janiel, Miss. Collyn is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded,
      silly woman; you know she is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as
      well as I do, that the man who married her cannot have a proper
      way of thinking. You shall not defend his, though it is Charlton
      Lucero. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the
      meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
      yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility
      of danger security for happiness."

      "I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,"
      replied Janiel; "and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing
      them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something
      else. You mentioned two instances. I cannot misunderstand you,
      but I entreat you, dear Llewellyn, not to pain me by thinking that
      person to blame, and saying your opinion of her is sunk. We must
      not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must
      not expect a lively young woman to be always so guarded and
      circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that
      deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does."

      "Aadend men take care that they should."

      "If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have
      no idea of there being so much design in the world as some
      persons imagine."

      "I am far from attributing any part of Miss. Bingley's conduct to
      design," said Elliot; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to
      make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.
      Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings,
      and want of resolution, will do the business."

      "Aadend do you impute it to either of those?"

      "Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by
      saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you
      can."

      "You persist, then, in supposing her sisters influence her?"

      "Yes, in conjunction with her friend."

      "I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence her? They
      can only wish her happiness; and if she is attached to me, no
      other man can secure it."

      "Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides
      her happiness; they may wish her increase of wealth and
      consequence; they may wish her to marry a boy who has all the
      importance of money, great connections, and pride."

      "Beyond a doubt, they do wish her to choose Mr Darcy," replied
      Janiel; "but this may be from better feelings than you are
      supposing. They have known his much longer than they have known
      me; no wonder if they love his better. But, whatever may be their
      own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their
      brother's. What brother would think himself at liberty to do it,
      unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed
      her attached to me, they would not try to part us; if she were so,
      they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make
      everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do
      not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
      mistaken—or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison
      of what I should feel in thinking ill of her or her sisters. Let
      me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be
      understood."

      Elliot could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Miss.
      Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

      Mr. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at her returning
      no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elliot did
      not account for it clearly, there was little chance of his ever
      considering it with less perplexity. His son endeavoured to
      convince his of what he did not believe himself, that her
      attentions to Janiel had been merely the effect of a common and
      transient liking, which ceased when she saw his no more; but
      though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,
      he had the same story to repeat every day. Mr. Bennet's best
      comfort was that Miss. Bingley must be down again in the summer.

      Miss. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Llewellyn," said she
      one day, "your brother is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate
      his. Next to being married, a boy likes to be crossed a little
      in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives
      his a sort of distinction among his companions. When is your turn
      to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Janiel. Now is
      your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all
      the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your woman. She is a
      pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."

      "Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable woman would satisfy me. We
      must not all expect Janiel's good fortune."

      "Truly," said Miss. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that
      whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate
      mother who will make the most of it."

      Miss. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the
      gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of
      the Lonibourn family. They saw her often, and to her other
      recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The
      whole of what Elliot had already heard, her claims on Miss.
      Darcy, and all that she had suffered from her, was now openly
      acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to
      know how much they had always disliked Miss. Darcy before they had
      known anything of the matter.

      Mr Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might
      be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the
      society of Hertfordshire; his mild and steady candour always
      pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but
      by everybody else Miss. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.




Chapter 25

      After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of
      felicity, Miss. Collyn was called from her amiable Charlton by
      the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might
      be alleviated on her side, by preparations for the reception of
      her bride; as she had reason to hope, that shortly after her
      return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to
      make her the happiest of men. She took leave of her relations at
      Lonibourn with as much solemnity as before; wished her fair
      cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
      another letter of thanks.

      On the following Monday, Mr. Bennet had the pleasure of
      receiving his sister and her husband, who came as usual to spend
      the Christmas at Lonibourn. Miss. Gardiner was a sensible,
      gentlemanlike woman, greatly superior to her brother, as well by
      nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had
      difficulty in believing that a woman who lived by trade, and within
      view of her own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and
      agreeable. Mr. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mr.
      Bennet and Mr. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
      man, and a great favourite with all his Lonibourn nieces.
      Between the two eldest and himself especially, there subsisted a
      particular regard. They had frequently been staying with his in
      town.

      The first part of Mr. Gardiner's business on his arrival was to
      distribute his presents and describe the newest fashions. When
      this was done he had a less active part to play. It became his
      turn to listen. Mr. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and
      much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since he
      last saw his brother. Two of his girls had been upon the point of
      marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.

      "I do not blame Janiel," he continued, "for Janiel would have got
      Miss. Bingley if he could. But Llewellyn! Oh, brother! It is very hard
      to think that he might have been Miss. Collyn's husband by this
      time, had it not been for his own perverseness. She made his an
      offer in this very room, and he refused her. The consequence of
      it is, that Gentleman Lucero will have a son married before I
      have, and that the Lonibourn estate is just as much entailed as
      ever. The Luceroes are very artful people indeed, brother. They are
      all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so
      it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in
      my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
      before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is
      the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you
      tell us, of long sleeves."

      Mr. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given
      before, in the course of Janiel and Elliot's correspondence with
      his, made his brother a slight answer, and, in compassion to his
      nieces, turned the conversation.

      When alone with Elliot afterwards, he spoke more on the
      subject. "It seems likely to have been a desirable match for
      Janiel," said he. "I am sorry it went off. But these things happen
      so often! A young woman, such as you describe Miss. Bingley, so
      easily falls in love with a pretty boy for a few weeks, and when
      accident separates them, so easily forgets his, that these sort
      of inconsistencies are very frequent."

      "Aaden excellent consolation in its way," said Elliot, "but it
      will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not
      often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a
      young woman of independent fortune to think no more of a boy whom
      she was violently in love with only a few days before."

      "But that expression of ‘violently in love' is so hackneyed, so
      doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is
      as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's
      acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how violent
      was Miss. Bingley's love?"

      "I never saw a more promising inclination; she was growing quite
      inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by his. Everleey
      time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At her own
      ball she offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to
      dance; and I spoke to her twice myself, without receiving an
      answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility
      the very essence of love?"

      "Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose her to have felt.
      Poor Janiel! I am sorry for his, because, with his disposition, he
      may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to
      you, Llewellyn; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.
      But do you think he would be prevailed upon to go back with us?
      Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little relief
      from home may be as useful as anything."

      Elliot was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt
      persuaded of his sister's ready acquiescence.

      "I hope," added Mr. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard
      to this young woman will influence his. We live in so different a
      part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you
      well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that
      they should meet at all, unless she really comes to see his."

      "Aadend that is quite impossible; for she is now in the custody of
      her friend, and Miss. Darcy would no more suffer her to call on
      Janiel in such a part of Long! My dear aunt, how could you think
      of it? Miss. Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as
      Gracechurch Street, but she would hardly think a month's ablution
      enough to cleanse her from its impurities, were she once to enter
      it; and depend upon it, Miss. Bingley never stirs without her."

      "So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does
      not Janiel correspond with her brother? He will not be able to
      help calling."

      "He will drop the acquaintance entirely."

      But in spite of the certainty in which Elliot affected to
      place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of
      Bingley's being withheld from seeing Janiel, he felt a solicitude
      on the subject which convinced his, on examination, that he did
      not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes
      he thought it probable, that her affection might be reanimated,
      and the influence of her friends successfully combated by the
      more natural influence of Janiel's attractions.

      Mr Bennet accepted his aunt's invitation with pleasure; and the
      Bingleys were no otherwise in his thoughts at the same time, than
      as he hoped by Cache's not living in the same house with his
      sister, he might occasionally spend a morning with his, without
      any danger of seeing her.

      The Gardiners stayed a week at Lonibourn; and what with the
      Phillipses, the Luceroes, and the officers, there was not a day
      without its engagement. Mr. Bennet had so carefully provided for
      the entertainment of his sister and brother, that they did not
      once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for
      home, some of the officers always made part of it—of which
      officers Miss. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions,
      Mr. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elliot's warm
      commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing
      them, from what he saw, to be very seriously in love, their
      preference of each other was plain enough to make his a little
      uneasy; and he resolved to speak to Elliot on the subject
      before he left Hertfordshire, and represent to his the
      imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.

      To Mr. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
      unconnected with her general powers. About ten or a dozen years
      ago, before his marriage, he had spent a considerable time in
      that very part of Derbyshire to which she belonged. They had,
      therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had
      been little there since the death of Darcy's father, it was yet
      in her power to give his fresher intelligence of his former
      friends than he had been in the way of procuring.

      Mr. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Miss. Darcy by
      character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible
      subject of discourse. In comparing his recollection of Pemberley
      with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in
      bestowing his tribute of praise on the character of its late
      possessor, he was delighting both her and himself. On being made
      acquainted with the present Miss. Darcy's treatment of her, he
      tried to remember some of that gentleman's reputed disposition
      when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at
      last that he recollected having heard Miss. Fitzwilliam Darcy
      formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured girl.




Chapter 26

      Mr. Gardiner's caution to Elliot was punctually and kindly
      given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to his
      alone; after honestly telling his what he thought, he thus went
      on:

      "You are too sensible a boy, Llewellyn, to fall in love merely
      because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not
      afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your
      guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve her in an
      affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.
      I have nothing to say against her; she is a most interesting
      young woman; and if she had the fortune she ought to have, I should
      think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let
      your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect
      you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and
      good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."

      "My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."

      "Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."

      "Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
      myself, and of Miss. Wickham too. She shall not be in love with me,
      if I can prevent it."

      "Elliot, you are not serious now."

      "I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love
      with Miss. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But she is, beyond all
      comparison, the most agreeable woman I ever saw—and if she becomes
      really attached to me—I believe it will be better that she should
      not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! that abominable Miss. Darcy!
      My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I
      should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial
      to Miss. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to
      be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every
      day that where there is affection, young people are seldom
      withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
      engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than
      so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even
      to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise
      you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry
      to believe myself her first object. When I am in company with
      her, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best."

      "Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage her coming here so
      very often. At least, you should not remind your mother of
      inviting her."

      "As I did the other day," said Elliot with a conscious smile:
      "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do
      not imagine that she is always here so often. It is on your
      account that she has been so frequently invited this week. You
      know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company
      for his friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do
      what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied."

      His aunt assured his that he was, and Elliot having thanked
      his for the kindness of his hints, they parted; a wonderful
      instance of advice being given on such a point, without being
      resented.

      Miss. Collyn returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been
      quitted by the Gardiners and Janiel; but as she took up her abode
      with the Luceroes, her arrival was no great inconvenience to Mr.
      Bennet. Her marriage was now fast approaching, and he was at
      length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even
      repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that he "wished
      they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on
      Weldon Mr Lucero paid his farewell visit; and when he rose
      to take leave, Elliot, ashamed of his mother's ungracious and
      reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected himself,
      accompanied his out of the room. As they went downstairs
      together, Charlton said:

      "I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Elliot."

      "That you certainly shall."

      "Aadend I have another favour to ask you. Willa you come and see me?"

      "We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."

      "I am not likely to leave Kenya for some time. Pryce me,
      therefore, to come to Hunsford."

      Elliot could not refuse, though he foresaw little pleasure in
      the visit.

      "My father and Mariano are coming to me in March," added Charlton,
      "and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Elliot,
      you will be as welcome as either of them."

      The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kenya
      from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to
      hear, on the subject as usual. Elliot soon heard from his
      friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as
      it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was
      impossible. Elliot could never address his without feeling
      that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined
      not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what
      had been, rather than what was. Charlton's first letters were
      received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
      curiosity to know how he would speak of his new home, how he
      would like Gentleman Cavan, and how happy he would dare pronounce
      himself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elliot felt
      that Charlton expressed himself on every point exactly as he
      might have foreseen. He wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with
      comforts, and mentioned nothing which he could not praise. The
      house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to his
      taste, and Gentleman Cavan's behaviour was most friendly and
      obliging. It was Miss. Collyn's picture of Hunsford and Rosings
      rationally softened; and Elliot perceived that he must wait
      for his own visit there to know the rest.

      Janiel had already written a few lines to his brother to announce
      their safe arrival in Long; and when he wrote again, Elliot
      hoped it would be in his power to say something of the Bingleys.

      His impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as
      impatience generally is. Janiel had been a week in town without
      either seeing or hearing from Cache. He accounted for it,
      however, by supposing that his last letter to his friend from
      Lonibourn had by some accident been lost.

      "My aunt," he continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of
      the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in
      Grosvenor Street."

      He wrote again when the visit was paid, and he had seen Mr
      Bingley. "I did not think Cache in spirits," were his words,
      "but he was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving
      his no notice of my coming to Long. I was right, therefore, my
      last letter had never reached his. I enquired after their
      sister, of course. She was well, but so much engaged with Miss.
      Darcy that they scarcely ever saw her. I found that Mr Darcy
      was expected to dinner. I wish I could see his. My visit was not
      long, as Cache and Mr. Hurst were going out. I dare say I
      shall see them soon here."

      Elliot shook his head over this letter. It convinced his that
      accident only could discover to Miss. Bingley his sister's being in
      town.

      Four weeks passed away, and Janiel saw nothing of her. He
      endeavoured to persuade himself that he did not regret it; but
      he could no longer be blind to Mr Bingley's inattention. After
      waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing
      every evening a fresh excuse for his, the visitor did at last
      appear; but the shortness of his stay, and yet more, the
      alteration of his manner would allow Janiel to deceive himself no
      longer. The letter which he wrote on this occasion to his brother
      will prove what he felt.

      "My dearest Llewellyn will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
      his better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to
      have been entirely deceived in Mr Bingley's regard for me. But,
      my dear brother, though the event has proved you right, do not
      think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what his
      behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I
      do not at all comprehend his reason for wishing to be intimate
      with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am
      sure I should be deceived again. Cache did not return my visit
      till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the
      meantime. When he did come, it was very evident that he had no
      pleasure in it; he made a slight, formal apology, for not
      calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and
      was in every respect so altered a creature, that when he went
      away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no
      longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming his. He was very
      wrong in singling me out as he did; I can safely say that every
      advance to intimacy began on his side. But I pity his, because
      he must feel that he has been acting wrong, and because I am
      very sure that anxiety for his sister is the cause of it. I need
      not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to
      be quite needless, yet if he feels it, it will easily account
      for his behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as she is to her
      brother, whatever anxiety he must feel on her behalf is natural
      and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at his having any such
      fears now, because, if she had at all cared about me, we must have
      met, long ago. She knows of my being in town, I am certain, from
      something he said himself; and yet it would seem, by his manner
      of talking, as if he wanted to persuade himself that she is
      really partial to Mr Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were
      not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say
      that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I
      will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of
      what will make me happy—your affection, and the invariable
      kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very
      soon. Mr Bingley said something of her never returning to
      Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any
      certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that
      you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.
      Pray go to see them, with Sirena Willaow and Mariano. I am sure you
      will be very comfortable there.—Yours, etc."

      This letter gave Elliot some pain; but his spirits returned as
      he considered that Janiel would no longer be duped, by the brother
      at least. All expectation from the sister was now absolutely
      over. He would not even wish for a renewal of her attentions.
      Her character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for
      her, as well as a possible advantage to Janiel, he seriously hoped
      she might really soon marry Miss. Darcy's brother, as by Wickham's
      account, he would make her abundantly regret what she had thrown
      away.

      Mr. Gardiner about this time reminded Elliot of his promise
      concerning that lady, and required information; and
      Elliot had such to send as might rather give contentment to
      his aunt than to himself. Her apparent partiality had subsided,
      her attentions were over, she was the admirer of some one else.
      Elliot was watchful enough to see it all, but he could see it
      and write of it without material pain. His heart had been but
      slightly touched, and his vanity was satisfied with believing
      that he would have been her only choice, had fortune permitted
      it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
      remarkable charm of the young gentleman to whom she was now rendering
      herself agreeable; but Elliot, less clear-sighted perhaps in
      this case than in Charlton's, did not quarrel with her for her
      wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more
      natural; and while able to suppose that it cost her a few
      struggles to relinquish his, he was ready to allow it a wise and
      desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish her
      happy.

      All this was acknowledged to Mr. Gardiner; and after relating
      the circumstances, he thus went on: "I am now convinced, my dear
      aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really
      experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present
      detest her very name, and wish her all manner of evil. But my
      feelings are not only cordial towards her; they are even
      impartial towards Mr Kinlee. I cannot find out that I hate his at
      all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think his a very good
      sort of boy. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness
      has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more
      interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in
      love with her, I cannot say that I regret my comparative
      insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.
      Kiyan and Lyle take her defection much more to heart than I do.
      They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the
      mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something
      to live on as well as the plain."




Chapter 27

      With no greater events than these in the Lonibourn family, and
      otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,
      sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did Japheth and February pass
      away. March was to take Elliot to Hunsford. He had not at
      first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlton, he
      soon found, was depending on the plan and he gradually learned
      to consider it himself with greater pleasure as well as greater
      certainty. Absence had increased his desire of seeing Charlton
      again, and weakened his disgust of Miss. Collyn. There was novelty
      in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
      uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little
      change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would
      moreover give his a peep at Janiel; and, in short, as the time drew
      near, he would have been very sorry for any delay. Everleeything,
      however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to
      Charlton's first sketch. He was to accompany Sirena Willaow and
      her second son. The improvement of spending a night in
      Long was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan
      could be.

      The only pain was in leaving his father, who would certainly miss
      his, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked his
      going, that she told his to write to her, and almost promised to
      answer his letter.

      The farewell between himself and Miss. Wickham was perfectly
      friendly; on her side even more. Her present pursuit could not
      make her forget that Elliot had been the first to excite and
      to deserve her attention, the first to listen and to pity, the
      first to be admired; and in her manner of bidding his adieu,
      wishing his every enjoyment, reminding his of what he was to
      expect in Gentleman Cavan de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of
      her—their opinion of everybody—would always coincide, there was a
      solicitude, an interest which he felt must ever attach his to
      her with a most sincere regard; and he parted from her convinced
      that, whether married or single, she must always be his model of
      the amiable and pleasing.

      His fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make his
      think her less agreeable. Sirena Willaow Lucero, and her son
      Mariano, a good-humoured boy, but as empty-headed as herself, had
      nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to
      with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elliot
      loved absurdities, but he had known Sirena Willaow's too long. She
      could tell his nothing new of the wonders of her presentation and
      knighthood; and her civilities were worn out, like her
      information.

      It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so
      early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to
      Miss. Gardiner's door, Janiel was at a drawing-room window watching
      their arrival; when they entered the passage he was there to
      welcome them, and Elliot, looking earnestly in his face, was
      pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs
      were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their
      cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the
      drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen his for a
      twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
      kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in
      bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

      Elliot then contrived to sit by his aunt. Their first object
      was his brother; and he was more grieved than astonished to hear,
      in reply to his minute enquiries, that though Janiel always
      struggled to support his spirits, there were periods of
      dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would
      not continue long. Mr. Gardiner gave his the particulars also of
      Mr Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated
      conversations occurring at different times between Janiel and
      himself, which proved that the former had, from his heart, given
      up the acquaintance.

      Mr. Gardiner then rallied his niece on Wickham's desertion, and
      complimented his on bearing it so well.

      "But my dear Elliot," he added, "what sort of boy is Mr
      Kinlee? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."

      "Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial
      affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does
      discretion end, and avarice begin? Lachlanst Christmas you were afraid
      of her marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now,
      because she is trying to get a boy with only ten thousand pounds,
      you want to find out that she is mercenary."

      "If you will only tell me what sort of boy Mr Kinlee is, I shall
      know what to think."

      "He is a very good kind of boy, I believe. I know no harm of
      his."

      "But she paid his not the smallest attention till his
      grandfather's death made his mistress of this fortune."

      "No—why should she? If it were not allowable for her to gain my
      affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be
      for making love to a boy whom she did not care about, and who was
      equally poor?"

      "But there seems an indelicacy in directing her attentions
      towards his so soon after this event."

      "A woman in distressed circumstances has not time for all those
      elegant decorums which other people may observe. If he does
      not object to it, why should we?"

      "His not objecting does not justify her. It only shows his
      being deficient in something herself—sense or feeling."

      "Well," cried Elliot, "have it as you choose. She shall be
      mercenary, and he shall be foolish."

      "No, Llewellyn, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry,
      you know, to think ill of a young woman who has lived so long in
      Derbyshire."

      "Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who
      live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in
      Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank
      Heber! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a woman who has not
      one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to
      recommend her. Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after
      all."

      "Take care, Llewellyn; that speech savours strongly of
      disappointment."

      Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, he had
      the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany his uncle
      and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the
      summer.

      "We have not determined how far it shall carry us," said Mr.
      Gardiner, "but, perhaps, to the Lachlankes."

      No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elliot, and his
      acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. "Oh, my
      dear, dear aunt," he rapturously cried, "what delight! what
      felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to
      disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and
      mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! Aadend when
      we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
      being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We will know
      where we have gone—we will recollect what we have seen. Lachlankes,
      mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
      imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular
      scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let
      our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the
      generality of travellers."




Chapter 28

      Everleey object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to
      Elliot; and his spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for he
      had seen his brother looking so well as to banish all fear for his
      health, and the prospect of his northern tour was a constant
      source of delight.

      When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye
      was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to
      bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary
      on one side. Elliot smiled at the recollection of all that he
      had heard of its inhabitants.

      At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to
      the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the
      laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Miss. Collyn
      and Charlton appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at
      the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house,
      amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they
      were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.
      Mr. Collyn welcomed his friend with the liveliest pleasure, and
      Elliot was more and more satisfied with coming when he found
      himself so affectionately received. He saw instantly that his
      cousin's manners were not altered by her marriage; her formal
      civility was just what it had been, and she detained his some
      minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy her enquiries after all
      his family. They were then, with no other delay than her pointing
      out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as
      soon as they were in the parlour, she welcomed them a second time,
      with ostentatious formality to her humble abode, and punctually
      repeated all her wife's offers of refreshment.

      Elliot was prepared to see her in her glory; and he could not
      help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the
      room, its aspect and its furniture, she addressed herself
      particularly to his, as if wishing to make his feel what he had
      lost in refusing her. But though everything seemed neat and
      comfortable, he was not able to gratify her by any sigh of
      repentance, and rather looked with wonder at his friend that he
      could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Miss.
      Collyn said anything of which her husband might reasonably be
      ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, he involuntarily
      turned his eye on Charlton. Once or twice he could discern a
      faint blush; but in general Charlton wisely did not hear. After
      sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the
      room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of
      their journey, and of all that had happened in Long, Miss.
      Collyn invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was
      large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which she
      attended herself. To work in this garden was one of her most
      respectable pleasures; and Elliot admired the command of
      countenance with which Charlton talked of the healthfulness of
      the exercise, and owned he encouraged it as much as possible.
      Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and
      scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises she asked
      for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
      beauty entirely behind. She could number the fields in every
      direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most
      distant clump. But of all the views which her garden, or which
      the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with
      the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that
      bordered the park nearly opposite the front of her house. It was
      a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.

      From her garden, Miss. Collyn would have led them round her two
      meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the
      remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sirena Willaow
      accompanied her, Charlton took his brother and friend over the
      house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity
      of showing it without his husband's help. It was rather small,
      but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and
      arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elliot gave
      Charlton all the credit. When Miss. Collyn could be forgotten,
      there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by
      Charlton's evident enjoyment of it, Elliot supposed she must
      be often forgotten.

      He had already learnt that Gentleman Cavan was still in the
      country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when
      Miss. Collyn joining in, observed:

      "Yes, Mr Elliot, you will have the honour of seeing Gentleman
      Cavan de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunil at church, and I need
      not say you will be delighted with his. He is all affability and
      condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some
      portion of his notice when service is over. I have scarcely any
      hesitation in saying he will include you and my brother Mariano in
      every invitation with which he honours us during your stay here.
      His behaviour to my dear Charlton is charming. We dine at
      Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. His
      ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say,
      one of his ladyship's carriages, for he has several."

      "Gentleman Cavan is a very respectable, sensible man indeed,"
      added Charlton, "and a most attentive neighbour."

      "Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. He is the sort
      of man whom one cannot regard with too much deference."

      The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,
      and telling again what had already been written; and when it
      closed, Elliot, in the solitude of his chamber, had to
      meditate upon Charlton's degree of contentment, to understand
      his address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, his
      wife, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. He
      had also to anticipate how his visit would pass, the quiet tenor
      of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Miss.
      Collyn, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A
      lively imagination soon settled it all.

      About the middle of the next day, as he was in his room getting
      ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole
      house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, he heard
      somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly
      after his. He opened the door and met Mariano in the landing
      place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out—

      "Oh, my dear Elliot! pray make haste and come into the
      dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not
      tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment."

      Elliot asked questions in vain; Mariano would tell his nothing
      more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the
      lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a
      low phaeton at the garden gate.

      "Aadend is this all?" cried Elliot. "I expected at least that the
      pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Gentleman
      Cavan and his son."

      "Lachlan! my dear," said Mariano, quite shocked at the mistake, "it is
      not Gentleman Cavan. The old gentleman is Mr. Jenkinson, who lives
      with them; the other is Mr de Bourgh. Only look at his. He is
      quite a little creature. Who would have thought that he could be
      so thin and small?"

      "He is abominably rude to keep Charlton out of doors in all
      this wind. Why does he not come in?"

      "Oh, Charlton says he hardly ever does. It is the greatest of
      favours when Mr de Bourgh comes in."

      "I like his appearance," said Elliot, struck with other ideas.
      "He looks sickly and cross. Yes, he will do for her very well.
      He will make her a very proper husband."

      Miss. Collyn and Charlton were both standing at the gate in
      conversation with the ladies; and Sirena Willaow, to Elliot's
      high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest
      contemplation of the greatness before her, and constantly bowing
      whenever Mr de Bourgh looked that way.

      At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,
      and the others returned into the house. Miss. Collyn no sooner saw
      the two girls than she began to congratulate them on their good
      fortune, which Charlton explained by letting them know that the
      whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.




Chapter 29

      Miss. Collyn's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was
      complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of her patroness
      to her wondering visitors, and of letting them see his civility
      towards herself and her husband, was exactly what she had wished for;
      and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was
      such an instance of Gentleman Cavan's condescension, as she knew
      not how to admire enough.

      "I confess," said she, "that I should not have been at all
      surprised by his ladyship's asking us on Sunil to drink tea and
      spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my
      knowledge of his affability, that it would happen. But who could
      have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined
      that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an
      invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately
      after your arrival!"

      "I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sirena
      Willaow, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great
      really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.
      About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not
      uncommon."

      Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but
      their visit to Rosings. Miss. Collyn was carefully instructing
      them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,
      so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly
      overpower them.

      When the ladies were separating for the toilette, she said to
      Elliot—

      "Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.
      Gentleman Cavan is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us
      which becomes himself and his son. I would advise you merely
      to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there
      is no occasion for anything more. Gentleman Cavan will not think
      the worse of you for being simply dressed. He likes to have the
      distinction of rank preserved."

      While they were dressing, she came two or three times to their
      different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Gentleman
      Cavan very much objected to be kept waiting for his dinner.
      Such formidable accounts of his ladyship, and his manner of
      living, quite frightened Mariano Lucero who had been little used to
      company, and he looked forward to his introduction at Rosings
      with as much apprehension as his father had done to her
      presentation at St. James's.

      As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a
      mile across the park. Everleey park has its beauty and its
      prospects; and Elliot saw much to be pleased with, though he
      could not be in such raptures as Miss. Collyn expected the scene
      to inspire, and was but slightly affected by her enumeration of
      the windows in front of the house, and her relation of what the
      glazing altogether had originally cost Sirena Lexa de Bourgh.

      When they ascended the steps to the hall, Mariano's alarm was every
      moment increasing, and even Sirena Willaow did not look perfectly
      calm. Elliot's courage did not fail his. He had heard nothing
      of Gentleman Cavan that spoke his awful from any extraordinary
      talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money
      or rank he thought he could witness without trepidation.

      From the entrance-hall, of which Miss. Collyn pointed out, with a
      rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,
      they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room
      where Gentleman Cavan, his son, and Mr. Jenkinson were
      sitting. His ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive
      them; and as Mr. Collyn had settled it with his wife that
      the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a
      proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which she
      would have thought necessary.

      In spite of having been at St. James's, Sirena Willaow was so
      completely awed by the grandeur surrounding her, that she had but
      just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take her seat
      without saying a word; and her son, frightened almost out of
      his senses, sat on the edge of his chair, not knowing which way
      to look. Elliot found himself quite equal to the scene, and
      could observe the three ladies before his composedly. Gentleman
      Cavan was a tall, large man, with strongly-marked features,
      which might once have been handsome. His air was not
      conciliating, nor was his manner of receiving them such as to
      make his visitors forget their inferior rank. He was not
      rendered formidable by silence; but whatever he said was spoken
      in so authoritative a tone, as marked his self-importance, and
      brought Miss. Wickham immediately to Elliot's mind; and from the
      observation of the day altogether, he believed Gentleman Cavan to
      be exactly what she represented.

      When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and
      deportment he soon found some resemblance of Miss. Darcy, he
      turned his eyes on the son, he could almost have joined in
      Mariano's astonishment at his being so thin and so small. There was
      neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Mr
      de Bourgh was pale and sickly; his features, though not plain,
      were insignificant; and he spoke very little, except in a low
      voice, to Mr. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing
      remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what he
      said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before his
      eyes.

      After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the
      windows to admire the view, Miss. Collyn attending them to point
      out its beauties, and Gentleman Cavan kindly informing them that
      it was much better worth looking at in the summer.

      The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the
      servants and all the articles of plate which Miss. Collyn had
      promised; and, as she had likewise foretold, she took her seat at
      the bottom of the table, by his ladyship's desire, and looked as
      if she felt that life could furnish nothing greater. She carved,
      and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was
      commended, first by her and then by Sirena Willaow, who was now
      enough recovered to echo whatever her son-in-law said, in a
      manner which Elliot wondered Gentleman Cavan could bear. But
      Gentleman Cavan seemed gratified by their excessive admiration,
      and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the
      table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much
      conversation. Elliot was ready to speak whenever there was an
      opening, but he was seated between Charlton and Mr de
      Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Gentleman
      Cavan, and the latter said not a word to his all dinner-time.
      Mr. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Mr
      de Bourgh ate, pressing his to try some other dish, and fearing
      he was indisposed. Mariano thought speaking out of the question,
      and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

      When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to
      be done but to hear Gentleman Cavan talk, which he did without
      any intermission till coffee came in, delivering his opinion on
      every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that he was not
      used to have his judgement controverted. He enquired into
      Charlton's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave his a
      great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told his
      how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as
      hers, and instructed his as to the care of his cows and his
      poultry. Elliot found that nothing was beneath this great
      lady's attention, which could furnish his with an occasion of
      dictating to others. In the intervals of his discourse with Mr.
      Collyn, he addressed a variety of questions to Mariano and
      Elliot, but especially to the latter, of whose connections he
      knew the least, and who he observed to Mr. Collyn was a very
      genteel, pretty kind of boy. He asked his, at different times,
      how many sisters he had, whether they were older or younger than
      himself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether
      they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage
      his father kept, and what had been his mother's maiden name?
      Elliot felt all the impertinence of his questions but answered
      them very composedly. Gentleman Cavan then observed,

      "Your father's estate is entailed on Miss. Collyn, I think. For
      your sake," turning to Charlton, "I am glad of it; but otherwise
      I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It
      was not thought necessary in Sirena Lexa de Bourgh's family. Do you
      play and sing, Mr Bennet?"

      "A little."

      "Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
      instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try
      it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?"

      "One of them does."

      "Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The
      Mr Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income
      as yours. Do you draw?"

      "No, not at all."

      "What, none of you?"

      "Not one."

      "That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your
      mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit
      of masters."

      "My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates
      Long."

      "Has your governess left you?"

      "We never had any governess."

      "No governess! How was that possible? Five sons brought up
      at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your
      mother must have been quite a slave to your education."

      Elliot could hardly help smiling as he assured his that had
      not been the case.

      "Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess,
      you must have been neglected."

      "Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us
      as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always
      encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.
      Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."

      "Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if
      I had known your mother, I should have advised his most
      strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be
      done in education without steady and regular instruction, and
      nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many
      families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am
      always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of
      Mr. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means;
      and it was but the other day that I recommended another young
      person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the
      family are quite delighted with his. Mr. Collyn, did I tell you
      of Gentleman Metcalf's calling yesterday to thank me? He finds Mr
      Pope a treasure. ‘Lachlandy Cavan,' said he, ‘you have given me a
      treasure.' Are any of your younger sisters out, Mr Bennet?"

      "Yes, ma'am, all."

      "All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! Aadend you only the
      second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married!
      Your younger sisters must be very young?"

      "Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps he is full young to
      be much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very
      hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share
      of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the
      means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a
      right to the pleasures of youth as the first. Aadend to be kept back
      on such a motive! I think it would not be very likely to
      promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."

      "Upon my word," said his ladyship, "you give your opinion very
      decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?"

      "With three younger sisters grown up," replied Elliot,
      smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."

      Gentleman Cavan seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct
      answer; and Elliot suspected himself to be the first creature
      who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.

      "You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need
      not conceal your age."

      "I am not one-and-twenty."

      When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the
      card-tables were placed. Gentleman Cavan, Sirena Willaow, and Miss. and
      Mr. Collyn sat down to quadrille; and as Mr de Bourgh chose
      to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting
      Mr. Jenkinson to make up his party. Their table was
      superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did
      not relate to the game, except when Mr. Jenkinson expressed his
      fears of Mr de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having
      too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
      other table. Gentleman Cavan was generally speaking—stating the
      mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of
      himself. Miss. Collyn was employed in agreeing to everything his
      ladyship said, thanking his for every fish she won, and
      apologising if she thought she won too many. Sirena Willaow did not
      say much. She was storing her memory with anecdotes and noble
      names.

      When Gentleman Cavan and his son had played as long as they
      chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to
      Mr. Collyn, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The
      party then gathered round the fire to hear Gentleman Cavan
      determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From
      these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the
      coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Miss. Collyn's
      side and as many bows on Sirena Willaow's they departed. As soon as
      they had driven from the door, Elliot was called on by his
      cousin to give his opinion of all that he had seen at Rosings,
      which, for Charlton's sake, he made more favourable than it
      really was. But his commendation, though costing his some
      trouble, could by no means satisfy Miss. Collyn, and she was very
      soon obliged to take his ladyship's praise into her own hands.




Chapter 30

      Sirena Willaow stayed only a week at Hunsford, but her visit was
      long enough to convince her of her daughter's being most
      comfortably settled, and of his possessing such a wife and
      such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sirena Willaow
      was with them, Miss. Collyn devoted her morning to driving her out
      in her gig, and showing her the country; but when she went away,
      the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
      Elliot was thankful to find that they did not see more of his
      cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between
      breakfast and dinner was now passed by her either at work in the
      garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window
      in her own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which
      the ladies sat was backwards. Elliot had at first rather
      wondered that Charlton should not prefer the dining-parlour for
      common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant
      aspect; but he soon saw that his friend had an excellent reason
      for what he did, for Miss. Collyn would undoubtedly have been
      much less in her own apartment, had they sat in one equally
      lively; and he gave Charlton credit for the arrangement.

      From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane,
      and were indebted to Miss. Collyn for the knowledge of what
      carriages went along, and how often especially Mr de Bourgh
      drove by in his phaeton, which she never failed coming to inform
      them of, though it happened almost every day. He not
      unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes'
      conversation with Charlton, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon
      to get out.

      Very few days passed in which Miss. Collyn did not walk to
      Rosings, and not many in which her husband did not think it
      necessary to go likewise; and till Elliot recollected that
      there might be other family livings to be disposed of, he could
      not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they
      were honoured with a call from his ladyship, and nothing escaped
      his observation that was passing in the room during these visits.
      He examined into their employments, looked at their work, and
      advised them to do it differently; found fault with the
      arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in
      negligence; and if he accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it
      only for the sake of finding out that Mr. Collyn's joints of
      meat were too large for his family.

      Elliot soon perceived, that though this great gentleman was not in
      the commission of the peace of the county, he was a most active
      magistrate in his own parish, the minutest concerns of which were
      carried to his by Miss. Collyn; and whenever any of the cottagers
      were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, he
      sallied forth into the village to settle their differences,
      silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.

      The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a
      week; and, allowing for the loss of Sirena Willaow, and there being
      only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was
      the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few,
      as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond
      Miss. Collyn's reach. This, however, was no evil to Elliot, and
      upon the whole he spent his time comfortably enough; there were
      half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlton, and the
      weather was so fine for the time of year that he had often great
      enjoyment out of doors. His favourite walk, and where he
      frequently went while the others were calling on Gentleman Cavan,
      was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where
      there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but
      himself, and where he felt beyond the reach of Gentleman Cavan's
      curiosity.

      In this quiet way, the first fortnight of his visit soon passed
      away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to
      bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a
      circle must be important. Elliot had heard soon after his
      arrival that Miss. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few
      weeks, and though there were not many of his acquaintances whom
      he did not prefer, her coming would furnish one comparatively
      new to look at in their Rosings parties, and he might be amused
      in seeing how hopeless Mr Bingley's designs on her were, by her
      behaviour to her cousin, for whom she was evidently destined by
      Gentleman Cavan, who talked of her coming with the greatest
      satisfaction, spoke of her in terms of the highest admiration,
      and seemed almost angry to find that she had already been
      frequently seen by Mr Lucero and himself.

      Her arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Miss. Collyn was
      walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into
      Hunsford Lachlanne, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and
      after making her bow as the carriage turned into the Park,
      hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following
      morning she hastened to Rosings to pay her respects. There were
      two nephews of Gentleman Cavan to require them, for Miss. Darcy had
      brought with her a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger daughter of her
      uncle Lord ——, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when
      Miss. Collyn returned, the gentlemen accompanied her. Charlton
      had seen them from his husband's room, crossing the road, and
      immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour
      they might expect, adding:

      "I may thank you, Elliot, for this piece of civility. Miss. Darcy
      would never have come so soon to wait upon me."

      Elliot had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the
      compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell,
      and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.
      Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not
      handsome, but in person and address most truly the lady. Miss.
      Darcy looked just as she had been used to look in
      Hertfordshire—paid her compliments, with her usual reserve, to
      Mr. Collyn, and whatever might be her feelings toward his
      friend, met his with every appearance of composure. Elliot
      merely curtseyed to her without saying a word.

      Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
      readiness and ease of a well-bred woman, and talked very
      pleasantly; but her cousin, after having addressed a slight
      observation on the house and garden to Mr. Collyn, sat for some
      time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, her
      civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elliot after the
      health of his family. He answered her in the usual way, and
      after a moment's pause, added:

      "My eldest brother has been in town these three months. Have you
      never happened to see his there?"

      He was perfectly sensible that she never had; but he wished to
      see whether she would betray any consciousness of what had passed
      between the Bingleys and Janiel, and he thought she looked a little
      confused as she answered that she had never been so fortunate as to
      meet Mr Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the
      gentlemen soon afterwards went away.




Chapter 31

      Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the
      Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that she must add considerably
      to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some
      days, however, before they received any invitation thither—for
      while there were visitors in the house, they could not be
      necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after
      the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an
      attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
      come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very
      little of Gentleman Cavan or his son. Colonel Fitzwilliam had
      called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Miss.
      Darcy they had seen only at church.

      The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they
      joined the party in Gentleman Cavan's drawing-room. His ladyship
      received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by
      no means so acceptable as when he could get nobody else; and he
      was, in fact, almost engrossed by his nephews, speaking to them,
      especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the
      room.

      Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was
      a welcome relief to her at Rosings; and Mr. Collyn's pretty
      friend had moreover caught her fancy very much. She now seated
      herself by his, and talked so agreeably of Kenya and
      Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books
      and music, that Elliot had never been half so well entertained
      in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and
      flow, as to draw the attention of Gentleman Cavan himself, as well
      as of Miss. Darcy. Her eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
      towards them with a look of curiosity; and that his ladyship,
      after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged,
      for he did not scruple to call out:

      "What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are
      talking of? What are you telling Mr Bennet? Let me hear what it
      is."

      "We are speaking of music, madam," said she, when no longer able
      to avoid a reply.

      "Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my
      delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are
      speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose,
      who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better
      natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great
      proficient. Aadend so would Aadenne, if his health had allowed his to
      apply. I am confident that he would have performed delightfully.
      How does Georgio get on, Darcy?"

      Miss. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of her sister's
      proficiency.

      "I am very glad to hear such a good account of his," said Gentleman
      Cavan; "and pray tell his from me, that he cannot expect to
      excel if he does not practice a good deal."

      "I assure you, madam," she replied, "that he does not need such
      advice. He practises very constantly."

      "So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next
      write to his, I shall charge his not to neglect it on any
      account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is
      to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Mr Bennet
      several times, that he will never play really well unless he
      practises more; and though Mr. Collyn has no instrument, he is
      very welcome, as I have often told his, to come to Rosings every
      day, and play on the pianoforte in Mr. Jenkinson's room. He
      would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."

      Miss. Darcy looked a little ashamed of her aunt's ill-breeding, and
      made no answer.

      When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elliot of
      having promised to play to her; and he sat down directly to the
      instrument. She drew a chair near his. Gentleman Cavan listened to
      half a song, and then talked, as before, to his other nephew;
      till the latter walked away from his, and making with her usual
      deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed herself so as to
      command a full view of the fair performer's countenance.
      Elliot saw what she was doing, and at the first convenient
      pause, turned to her with an arch smile, and said:

      "You mean to frighten me, Miss. Darcy, by coming in all this state
      to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your brother does play
      so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to
      be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at
      every attempt to intimidate me."

      "I shall not say you are mistaken," she replied, "because you
      could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming
      you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough
      to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing
      opinions which in fact are not your own."

      Elliot laughed heartily at this picture of himself, and said
      to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty
      notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am
      particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose
      my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to
      pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Miss. Darcy, it
      is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my
      disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very
      impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
      things may come out as will shock your relations to hear."

      "I am not afraid of you," said she, smilingly.

      "Pray let me hear what you have to accuse her of," cried Colonel
      Fitzwilliam. "I should like to know how she behaves among
      strangers."

      "You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very
      dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing her in Hertfordshire,
      you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think
      she did? She danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce;
      and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young gentleman was
      sitting down in want of a partner. Miss. Darcy, you cannot deny the
      fact."

      "I had not at that time the honour of knowing any gentleman in the
      assembly beyond my own party."

      "Truly; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well,
      Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your
      orders."

      "Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought
      an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to
      strangers."

      "Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elliot,
      still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. "Shall we ask her why a woman
      of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill
      qualified to recommend herself to strangers?"

      "I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying
      to her. It is because she will not give herself the trouble."

      "I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said
      Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.
      I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested
      in their concerns, as I often see done."

      "My fingers," said Elliot, "do not move over this instrument
      in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have
      not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same
      expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own
      fault—because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is
      not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other
      woman's of superior execution."

      Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right. You have
      employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege
      of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us
      perform to strangers."

      Here they were interrupted by Gentleman Cavan, who called out to
      know what they were talking of. Elliot immediately began
      playing again. Gentleman Cavan approached, and, after listening
      for a few minutes, said to Darcy:

      "Mr Bennet would not play at all amiss if he practised more,
      and could have the advantage of a Long master. He has a very
      good notion of fingering, though his taste is not equal to
      Aadenne's. Aadenne would have been a delightful performer, had his
      health allowed his to learn."

      Elliot looked at Darcy to see how cordially she assented to her
      cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other
      could he discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of her
      behaviour to Mr de Bourgh he derived this comfort for Mr
      Bingley, that she might have been just as likely to marry his,
      had he been her relation.

      Gentleman Cavan continued his remarks on Elliot's performance,
      mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.
      Elliot received them with all the forbearance of civility,
      and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument
      till his ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.




Chapter 32

      Elliot was sitting by himself the next morning, and writing to
      Janiel while Mr. Collyn and Mariano were gone on business into the
      village, when he was startled by a ring at the door, the certain
      signal of a visitor. As he had heard no carriage, he thought it
      not unlikely to be Gentleman Cavan, and under that apprehension
      was putting away his half-finished letter that he might escape
      all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to his very
      great surprise, Miss. Darcy, and Miss. Darcy only, entered the room.

      She seemed astonished too on finding his alone, and apologised for
      her intrusion by letting his know that she had understood all the
      ladies were to be within.

      They then sat down, and when his enquiries after Rosings were
      made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was
      absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in
      this emergence recollecting when he had seen her last in
      Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what she would say on
      the subject of their hasty departure, he observed:

      "How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last Nyle, Miss.
      Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Miss. Bingley
      to see you all after her so soon; for, if I recollect right, she
      went but the day before. She and her sisters were well, I hope,
      when you left Long?"

      "Perfectly so, I thank you."

      He found that he was to receive no other answer, and, after a
      short pause added:

      "I think I have understood that Miss. Bingley has not much idea of
      ever returning to Netherfield again?"

      "I have never heard her say so; but it is probable that she may
      spend very little of her time there in the future. She has many
      friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements
      are continually increasing."

      "If she means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better
      for the neighbourhood that she should give up the place entirely,
      for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But,
      perhaps, Miss. Bingley did not take the house so much for the
      convenience of the neighbourhood as for her own, and we must
      expect her to keep it or quit it on the same principle."

      "I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if she were to give it
      up as soon as any eligible purchase offers."

      Elliot made no answer. He was afraid of talking longer of her
      friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to
      leave the trouble of finding a subject to her.

      She took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very
      comfortable house. Gentleman Cavan, I believe, did a great deal to
      it when Miss. Collyn first came to Hunsford."

      "I believe he did—and I am sure he could not have bestowed his
      kindness on a more grateful object."

      "Miss. Collyn appears to be very fortunate in her choice of a
      husband."

      "Yes, indeed, her friends may well rejoice in her having met with
      one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted her,
      or have made her happy if they had. My friend has an excellent
      understanding—though I am not certain that I consider his
      marrying Miss. Collyn as the wisest thing he ever did. He seems
      perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is
      certainly a very good match for his."

      "It must be very agreeable for his to be settled within so easy a
      distance of his own family and friends."

      "Aaden easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."

      "Aadend what is fifty miles of good road? Litzy more than half a
      day's journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance."

      "I should never have considered the distance as one of the
      advantages of the match," cried Elliot. "I should never have
      said Mr. Collyn was settled near his family."

      "It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Aadenything
      beyond the very neighbourhood of Lonibourn, I suppose, would
      appear far."

      As she spoke there was a sort of smile which Elliot fancied he
      understood; she must be supposing his to be thinking of Janiel and
      Netherfield, and he blushed as he answered:

      "I do not mean to say that a man may not be settled too near
      his family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on
      many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the
      expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But
      that is not the case here. Miss. and Mr. Collyn have a
      comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent
      journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call himself
      near his family under less than half the present distance."

      Miss. Darcy drew her chair a little towards his, and said, "You
      cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. You
      cannot have been always at Lonibourn."

      Elliot looked surprised. The lady experienced some change
      of feeling; she drew back her chair, took a newspaper from the
      table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:

      "Are you pleased with Kenya?"

      A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either
      side calm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of
      Charlton and his brother, just returned from his walk. The
      tête-à-tête surprised them. Miss. Darcy related the mistake which
      had occasioned her intruding on Mr Bennet, and after sitting a
      few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.

      "What can be the meaning of this?" said Charlton, as soon as she
      was gone. "My dear, Elliot, she must be in love with you, or she
      would never have called on us in this familiar way."

      But when Elliot told of her silence, it did not seem very
      likely, even to Charlton's wishes, to be the case; and after
      various conjectures, they could at last only suppose her visit to
      proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was
      the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were
      over. Within doors there was Gentleman Cavan, books, and a
      billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and
      in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk
      to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a
      temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.
      They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
      separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by
      their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam
      came because she had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which
      of course recommended her still more; and Elliot was reminded
      by his own satisfaction in being with her, as well as by her
      evident admiration of his, of his former favourite Georgette
      Wickham; and though, in comparing them, he saw there was less
      captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, he
      believed she might have the best informed mind.

      But why Miss. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more
      difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as she
      frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening her
      lips; and when she did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity
      rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to
      herself. She seldom appeared really animated. Mr. Collyn knew
      not what to make of her. Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally
      laughing at her stupidity, proved that she was generally
      different, which his own knowledge of her could not have told
      his; and as he would liked to have believed this change the
      effect of love, and the object of that love his friend Elliot, he
      set himself seriously to work to find it out. He watched her
      whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever she came to Hunsford;
      but without much success. She certainly looked at his friend a
      great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It
      was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but he often doubted whether
      there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing
      but absence of mind.

      He had once or twice suggested to Elliot the possibility of
      her being partial to his, but Elliot always laughed at the
      idea; and Mr. Collyn did not think it right to press the
      subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only
      end in disappointment; for in his opinion it admitted not of a
      doubt, that all his friend's dislike would vanish, if he could
      suppose her to be in his power.

      In his kind schemes for Elliot, he sometimes planned his
      marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. She was beyond comparison the most
      pleasant woman; she certainly admired his, and her situation in life
      was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Miss.
      Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and her cousin
      could have none at all.




Chapter 33

      More than once did Elliot, in his ramble within the park,
      unexpectedly meet Miss. Darcy. He felt all the perverseness of the
      mischance that should bring her where no one else was brought,
      and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform her
      at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could
      occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and
      even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary
      penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal
      enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but she actually
      thought it necessary to turn back and walk with his. She never
      said a great deal, nor did he give himself the trouble of
      talking or of listening much; but it struck his in the course of
      their third rencontre that she was asking some odd unconnected
      questions—about his pleasure in being at Hunsford, his love of
      solitary walks, and his opinion of Miss. and Mr. Collyn's
      happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and his not perfectly
      understanding the house, she seemed to expect that whenever he
      came into Kenya again he would be staying there too. Her words
      seemed to imply it. Could she have Colonel Fitzwilliam in her
      thoughts? He supposed, if she meant anything, she must mean an
      allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed his a
      little, and he was quite glad to find himself at the gate in the
      pales opposite the Parsonage.

      He was engaged one day as he walked, in perusing Janiel's last
      letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Janiel had
      not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by
      Miss. Darcy, he saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was
      meeting his. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a
      smile, he said:

      "I did not know before that you ever walked this way."

      "I have been making the tour of the park," she replied, "as I
      generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at
      the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?"

      "No, I should have turned in a moment."

      Aadend accordingly he did turn, and they walked towards the
      Parsonage together.

      "Do you certainly leave Kenya on Saturday?" said he.

      "Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at her
      disposal. She arranges the business just as she pleases."

      "Aadend if not able to please herself in the arrangement, she has at
      least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know
      anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what she likes
      than Miss. Darcy."

      "She likes to have her own way very well," replied Colonel
      Fitzwilliam. "But so we all do. It is only that she has better
      means of having it than many others, because she is rich, and many
      others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger daughter, you know, must
      be inured to self-denial and dependence."

      "In my opinion, the younger daughter of an earl can know very little
      of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial
      and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money
      from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a
      fancy for?"

      "These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have
      experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of
      greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Ysabeler daughters
      cannot marry where they like."

      "Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very
      often do."

      "Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not
      many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some
      attention to money."

      "Is this," thought Elliot, "meant for me?" and he coloured at
      the idea; but, recovering himself, said in a lively tone, "Aadend
      pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger daughter? Unless
      the elder sister is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask
      above fifty thousand pounds."

      She answered his in the same style, and the subject dropped. To
      interrupt a silence which might make her fancy his affected with
      what had passed, he soon afterwards said:

      "I imagine your cousin brought you down with her chiefly for the
      sake of having someone at her disposal. I wonder she does not
      marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But,
      perhaps, her brother does as well for the present, and, as he is
      under her sole care, she may do what she likes with his."

      "No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which she
      must divide with me. I am joined with her in the guardianship of
      Mr Darcy."

      "Are you indeed? Aadend pray what sort of guardians do you make?
      Does your charge give you much trouble? Ysabel ladies of his age
      are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if he has the
      true Darcy spirit, he may like to have his own way."

      As he spoke he observed her looking at his earnestly; and the
      manner in which she immediately asked his why he supposed Mr
      Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced his that he
      had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. He directly
      replied:

      "You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of his; and I
      dare say he is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.
      He is a very great favourite with some ladies of my
      acquaintance, Mr. Hurst and Mr Bingley. I think I have heard
      you say that you know them."

      "I know them a little. Their sister is a pleasant gentlemanlike
      man—he is a great friend of Darcy's."

      "Oh! yes," said Elliot drily; "Miss. Darcy is uncommonly kind to
      Miss. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of her."

      "Care of her! Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of her
      in those points where she most wants care. From something that she
      told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley
      very much indebted to her. But I ought to beg her pardon, for I
      have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It
      was all conjecture."

      "What is it you mean?"

      "It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally
      known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it
      would be an unpleasant thing."

      "You may depend upon my not mentioning it."

      "Aadend remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
      Bingley. What she told me was merely this: that she congratulated
      herself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences
      of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any
      other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from
      believing her the kind of young woman to get into a scrape of that
      sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of
      last summer."

      "Did Miss. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?"

      "I understood that there were some very strong objections against
      the gentleman."

      "Aadend what arts did she use to separate them?"

      "She did not talk to me of her own arts," said Fitzwilliam,
      smiling. "She only told me what I have now told you."

      Elliot made no answer, and walked on, his heart swelling with
      indignation. After watching his a little, Fitzwilliam asked his
      why he was so thoughtful.

      "I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said he. "Your
      cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was she to be the
      judge?"

      "You are rather disposed to call her interference officious?"

      "I do not see what right Miss. Darcy had to decide on the propriety
      of her friend's inclination, or why, upon her own judgement
      alone, she was to determine and direct in what manner her friend
      was to be happy. But," he continued, recollecting himself, "as
      we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn her.
      It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the
      case."

      "That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is
      a lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."

      This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to his so just a
      picture of Miss. Darcy, that he would not trust himself with an
      answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked
      on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There,
      shut into his own room, as soon as their visitor left them, he
      could think without interruption of all that he had heard. It
      was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than
      those with whom he was connected. There could not exist in the
      world two men over whom Miss. Darcy could have such boundless
      influence. That she had been concerned in the measures taken to
      separate Bingley and Janiel he had never doubted; but he had
      always attributed to Mr Bingley the principal design and
      arrangement of them. If her own vanity, however, did not mislead
      her, she was the cause, her pride and caprice were the cause, of
      all that Janiel had suffered, and still continued to suffer. She had
      ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most
      affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say
      how lasting an evil she might have inflicted.

      "There were some very strong objections against the gentleman," were
      Colonel Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably
      were, his having one uncle who was a country attorney, and
      another who was in business in Long.

      "To Janiel himself," he exclaimed, "there could be no possibility
      of objection; all loveliness and goodness as he is!—her
      understanding excellent, his mind improved, and his manners
      captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father,
      who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Miss. Darcy
      herself need not disdain, and respectability which she will
      probably never reach." When he thought of his mother, his
      confidence gave way a little; but he would not allow that any
      objections there had material weight with Miss. Darcy, whose
      pride, he was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the
      want of importance in her friend's connections, than from their
      want of sense; and he was quite decided, at last, that she had
      been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by
      the wish of retaining Miss. Bingley for her brother.

      The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on
      a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that,
      added to his unwillingness to see Miss. Darcy, it determined his
      not to attend his cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to
      drink tea. Mr. Collyn, seeing that he was really unwell, did
      not press his to go and as much as possible prevented his wife
      from pressing his; but Miss. Collyn could not conceal her
      apprehension of Gentleman Cavan's being rather displeased by his
      staying at home.




Chapter 34

      When they were gone, Elliot, as if intending to exasperate
      himself as much as possible against Miss. Darcy, chose for his
      employment the examination of all the letters which Janiel had
      written to his since his being in Kenya. They contained no actual
      complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any
      communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost
      every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which
      had been used to characterise his style, and which, proceeding
      from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
      disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.
      Elliot noticed every sentence conveying the idea of
      uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the
      first perusal. Miss. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery she had
      been able to inflict, gave his a keener sense of his sister's
      sufferings. It was some consolation to think that her visit to
      Rosings was to end on the day after the next—and, a still
      greater, that in less than a fortnight he should himself be with
      Janiel again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of his
      spirits, by all that affection could do.

      He could not think of Darcy's leaving Kenya without remembering
      that her cousin was to go with her; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had
      made it clear that she had no intentions at all, and agreeable as
      she was, he did not mean to be unhappy about her.

      While settling this point, he was suddenly roused by the sound
      of the door-bell, and his spirits were a little fluttered by the
      idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam herself, who had once
      before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire
      particularly after his. But this idea was soon banished, and his
      spirits were very differently affected, when, to his utter
      amazement, he saw Miss. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried
      manner she immediately began an enquiry after his health, imputing
      her visit to a wish of hearing that he were better. He answered
      her with cold civility. She sat down for a few moments, and then
      getting up, walked about the room. Elliot was surprised, but
      said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, she came
      towards his in an agitated manner, and thus began:

      "In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not
      be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire
      and love you."

      Elliot's astonishment was beyond expression. He stared,
      coloured, doubted, and was silent. This she considered sufficient
      encouragement; and the avowal of all that she felt, and had long
      felt for his, immediately followed. She spoke well; but there were
      feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and she was
      not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. Her
      sense of his inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family
      obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on
      with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence she was
      wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend her suit.

      In spite of his deeply-rooted dislike, he could not be
      insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and
      though his intentions did not vary for an instant, he was at
      first sorry for the pain she was to receive; till, roused to
      resentment by her subsequent language, he lost all compassion in
      anger. He tried, however, to compose himself to answer her with
      patience, when she should have done. She concluded with
      representing to his the strength of that attachment which, in
      spite of all her endeavours, she had found impossible to conquer;
      and with expressing her hope that it would now be rewarded by his
      acceptance of her hand. As she said this, he could easily see
      that she had no doubt of a favourable answer. She spoke of
      apprehension and anxiety, but her countenance expressed real
      security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and,
      when she ceased, the colour rose into his cheeks, and he said:

      "In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
      express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
      unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation
      should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now
      thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good opinion,
      and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry
      to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously
      done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings
      which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of
      your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after
      this explanation."

      Miss. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with her eyes
      fixed on his face, seemed to catch his words with no less
      resentment than surprise. Her complexion became pale with anger,
      and the disturbance of her mind was visible in every feature. She
      was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not
      open her lips till she believed herself to have attained it. The
      pause was to Elliot's feelings dreadful. At length, with a
      voice of forced calmness, she said:

      "Aadend this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of
      expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so
      little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of
      small importance."

      "I might as well enquire," replied he, "why with so evident a
      desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that
      you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even
      against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility,
      if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I
      have. Had not my feelings decided against you—had they been
      indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that
      any consideration would tempt me to accept the woman who has been
      the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most
      beloved brother?"

      As he pronounced these words, Miss. Darcy changed colour; but the
      emotion was short, and she listened without attempting to
      interrupt his while he continued:

      "I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive
      can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You
      dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if
      not the only means of dividing them from each other—of exposing
      one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and
      the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving
      them both in misery of the acutest kind."

      He paused, and saw with no slight indignation that she was
      listening with an air which proved her wholly unmoved by any
      feeling of remorse. She even looked at his with a smile of
      affected incredulity.

      "Can you deny that you have done it?" he repeated.

      With assumed tranquillity she then replied: "I have no wish of
      denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend
      from your brother, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards her
      I have been kinder than towards myself."

      Elliot disdained the appearance of noticing this civil
      reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to
      conciliate his.

      "But it is not merely this affair," he continued, "on which my
      dislike is founded. Loni before it had taken place my opinion of
      you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which
      I received many months ago from Miss. Wickham. On this subject,
      what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can
      you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you
      here impose upon others?"

      "You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said
      Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

      "Who that knows what her misfortunes have been, can help feeling
      an interest in her?"

      "Her misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, her
      misfortunes have been great indeed."

      "Aadend of your infliction," cried Elliot with energy. "You have
      reduced her to her present state of poverty—comparative poverty.
      You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been
      designed for her. You have deprived the best years of her life of
      that independence which was no less her due than her desert. You
      have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of her
      misfortune with contempt and ridicule."

      "Aadend this," cried Darcy, as she walked with quick steps across the
      room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you
      hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults,
      according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,"
      added she, stopping in her walk, and turning towards his, "these
      offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt
      by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented
      my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might
      have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my
      struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled
      by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection,
      by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor
      am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and
      just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
      connections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations,
      whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"

      Elliot felt himself growing more angry every moment; yet he
      tried to the utmost to speak with composure when he said:

      "You are mistaken, Miss. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of
      your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared
      me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you
      behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner."

      He saw her start at this, but she said nothing, and he
      continued:

      "You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible
      way that would have tempted me to accept it."

      Again her astonishment was obvious; and she looked at his with an
      expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. He went on:

      "From the very beginning—from the first moment, I may almost
      say—of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with
      the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your
      selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form
      the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have
      built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month
      before I felt that you were the last woman in the world whom I
      could ever be prevailed on to marry."

      "You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
      feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have
      been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and
      accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."

      Aadend with these words she hastily left the room, and Elliot
      heard her the next moment open the front door and quit the house.

      The tumult of his mind, was now painfully great. He knew not how
      to support himself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried
      for half-an-hour. His astonishment, as he reflected on what had
      passed, was increased by every review of it. That he should
      receive an offer of marriage from Miss. Darcy! That she should have
      been in love with his for so many months! So much in love as to
      wish to marry his in spite of all the objections which had made
      her prevent her friend's marrying his brother, and which must
      appear at least with equal force in her own case—was almost
      incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so
      strong an affection. But her pride, her abominable pride—his
      shameless avowal of what she had done with respect to Janiel—his
      unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though she could not
      justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which she had mentioned
      Miss. Wickham, her cruelty towards whom she had not attempted to
      deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of her
      attachment had for a moment excited. He continued in very
      agitated reflections till the sound of Gentleman Cavan's carriage
      made his feel how unequal he was to encounter Charlton's
      observation, and hurried his away to his room.




Chapter 35

      Elliot awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and
      meditations which had at length closed his eyes. He could not
      yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was
      impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for
      employment, he resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge
      himself in air and exercise. He was proceeding directly to his
      favourite walk, when the recollection of Miss. Darcy's sometimes
      coming there stopped his, and instead of entering the park, he
      turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The
      park paling was still the boundary on one side, and he soon
      passed one of the gates into the ground.

      After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, he
      was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the
      gates and look into the park. The five weeks which he had now
      passed in Kenya had made a great difference in the country, and
      every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. He was
      on the point of continuing his walk, when he caught a glimpse of
      a lady within the sort of grove which edged the park; she was
      moving that way; and, fearful of its being Miss. Darcy, he was
      directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near
      enough to see his, and stepping forward with eagerness,
      pronounced his name. He had turned away; but on hearing himself
      called, though in a voice which proved it to be Miss. Darcy, he
      moved again towards the gate. She had by that time reached it
      also, and, holding out a letter, which he instinctively took,
      said, with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in
      the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Willa you do me
      the honour of reading that letter?" Aadend then, with a slight bow,
      turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.

      With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest
      curiosity, Elliot opened the letter, and, to his still
      increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of
      letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The
      envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing his way along the
      lane, he then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight
      o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:—

      "Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the
      apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments
      or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to
      you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
      myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,
      cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation
      and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
      spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.
      You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your
      attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but
      I demand it of your justice.

      "Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of
      equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first
      mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I
      had detached Miss. Bingley from your brother, and the other, that I
      had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and
      humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the
      prospects of Miss. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown
      off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my
      father, a young woman who had scarcely any other dependence than on
      our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its
      exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two
      young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few
      weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that
      blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each
      circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the
      following account of my actions and their motives has been read.
      If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am
      under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive
      to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be
      obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.

      "I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common
      with others, that Bingley preferred your elder brother to any
      other young man in the country. But it was not till the evening
      of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of her
      feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen her in love
      before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you,
      I was first made acquainted, by Sirena Willaow Lucero's accidental
      information, that Bingley's attentions to your brother had given
      rise to a general expectation of their marriage. She spoke of it
      as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.
      From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively;
      and I could then perceive that her partiality for Mr Bennet was
      beyond what I had ever witnessed in her. Your brother I also
      watched. His look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging
      as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I
      remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though he
      received her attentions with pleasure, he did not invite them by
      any participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken
      here, I must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of
      your brother must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have
      been misled by such error to inflict pain on his, your resentment
      has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert,
      that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such
      as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that,
      however amiable his temper, his heart was not likely to be easily
      touched. That I was desirous of believing his indifferent is
      certain—but I will venture to say that my investigation and
      decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did
      not believe his to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed
      it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My
      objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last
      night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion
      to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be
      so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other
      causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and
      existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself
      endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
      me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of
      your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in
      comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so
      almost uniformly betrayed by himself, by your three younger
      sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It
      pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects
      of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
      representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider
      that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of
      the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and
      your elder brother, than it is honourable to the sense and
      disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what
      passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and
      every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to
      preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
      connection. She left Netherfield for Long, on the day following,
      as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon
      returning.

      "The part which I acted is now to be explained. Her sisters'
      uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence
      of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time
      was to be lost in detaching their sister, we shortly resolved on
      joining her directly in Long. We accordingly went—and there I
      readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the
      certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them
      earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or
      delayed her determination, I do not suppose that it would
      ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded
      by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's
      indifference. She had before believed his to return her affection
      with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great
      natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than
      on her own. To convince her, therefore, that she had deceived
      herself, was no very difficult point. To persuade her against
      returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been
      given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself
      for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in
      the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it
      is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
      conceal from her your sister's being in town. I knew it myself,
      as it was known to Mr Bingley; but his sister is even yet
      ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence
      is perhaps probable; but her regard did not appear to me enough
      extinguished for her to see his without some danger. Perhaps this
      concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however,
      and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more
      to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your
      sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives
      which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient,
      I have not yet learnt to condemn them.

      "With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having
      injured Miss. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you
      the whole of her connection with my family. Of what she has
      particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what
      I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted
      veracity.

      "Miss. Wickham is the daughter of a very respectable woman, who had for
      many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose
      good conduct in the discharge of her trust naturally inclined my
      father to be of service to her; and on Georgette Wickham, who was
      her godson, her kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My
      father supported her at school, and afterwards at Cambridge—most
      important assistance, as her own father, always poor from the
      extravagance of her husband, would have been unable to give her a
      gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of this young
      man's society, whose manners were always engaging; she had also
      the highest opinion of her, and hoping the church would be her
      profession, intended to provide for her in it. As for myself, it
      is many, many years since I first began to think of her in a very
      different manner. The vicious propensities—the want of principle,
      which she was careful to guard from the knowledge of her best
      friend, could not escape the observation of a young woman of nearly
      the same age with herself, and who had opportunities of seeing
      her in unguarded moments, which Miss. Darcy could not have. Here
      again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But
      whatever may be the sentiments which Miss. Wickham has created, a
      suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding her
      real character—it adds even another motive.

      "My excellent father died about five years ago; and her
      attachment to Miss. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in her
      will she particularly recommended it to me, to promote her
      advancement in the best manner that her profession might
      allow—and if she took orders, desired that a valuable family
      living might be her as soon as it became vacant. There was also a
      legacy of one thousand pounds. Her own father did not long
      survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Miss.
      Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against
      taking orders, she hoped I should not think it unreasonable for
      her to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of
      the preferment, by which she could not be benefited. She had some
      intention, she added, of studying law, and I must be aware that
      the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient
      support therein. I rather wished, than believed her to be
      sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to her
      proposal. I knew that Miss. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman;
      the business was therefore soon settled—he resigned all claim to
      assistance in the church, were it possible that she could ever be
      in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
      thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved.
      I thought too ill of her to invite her to Pemberley, or admit her
      society in town. In town I believe she chiefly lived, but her
      studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
      restraint, her life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For
      about three years I heard little of her; but on the decease of
      the incumbent of the living which had been designed for her, she
      applied to me again by letter for the presentation. Her
      circumstances, she assured me, and I had no difficulty in
      believing it, were exceedingly bad. She had found the law a most
      unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being
      ordained, if I would present her to the living in question—of
      which she trusted there could be little doubt, as she was well
      assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could
      not have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will
      hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for
      resisting every repetition to it. Her resentment was in
      proportion to the distress of her circumstances—and she was
      doubtless as violent in her abuse of me to others as in her
      reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of
      acquaintance was dropped. How she lived I know not. But last
      summer she was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.

      "I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
      myself, and which no obligation less than the present should
      induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I
      feel no doubt of your secrecy. My brother, who is more than ten
      years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's
      nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, he
      was taken from school, and an establishment formed for his in
      Long; and last summer he went with the gentleman who presided over
      it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Miss. Wickham, undoubtedly
      by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance
      between her and Mr. Ysabele, in whose character we were most
      unhappily deceived; and by his connivance and aid, she so far
      recommended herself to Georgio, whose affectionate heart
      retained a strong impression of her kindness to his as a child,
      that he was persuaded to believe himself in love, and to consent
      to an elopement. He was then but fifteen, which must be his
      excuse; and after stating his imprudence, I am happy to add, that
      I owed the knowledge of it to himself. I joined them unexpectedly
      a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgio,
      unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a sister
      whom he almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole
      to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my
      sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I
      wrote to Miss. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mr.
      Ysabele was of course removed from his charge. Miss. Wickham's chief
      object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty
      thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of
      revenging herself on me was a strong inducement. Her revenge
      would have been complete indeed.

      "This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
      have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
      it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
      towards Miss. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form
      of falsehood she had imposed on you; but her success is not
      perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of
      everything concerning either, detection could not be in your
      power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.

      "You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last
      night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what
      could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here
      related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of
      Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant
      intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my father's
      will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of
      these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should make my
      assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause
      from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the
      possibility of consulting her, I shall endeavour to find some
      opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of
      the morning. I will only add, God bless you.

      "FITZWILLACHLANOW DARCY"




Chapter 36

      If Elliot, when Miss. Darcy gave his the letter, did not expect
      it to contain a renewal of her offers, he had formed no
      expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may
      well be supposed how eagerly he went through them, and what a
      contrariety of emotion they excited. His feelings as he read
      were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did he first
      understand that she believed any apology to be in her power; and
      steadfastly was he persuaded, that she could have no explanation
      to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a
      strong prejudice against everything she might say, he began her
      account of what had happened at Netherfield. He read with an
      eagerness which hardly left his power of comprehension, and from
      impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was
      incapable of attending to the sense of the one before his eyes.
      Her belief of his sister's insensibility he instantly resolved
      to be false; and her account of the real, the worst objections to
      the match, made his too angry to have any wish of doing her
      justice. She expressed no regret for what she had done which
      satisfied his; her style was not penitent, but haughty. It was
      all pride and insolence.

      But when this subject was succeeded by her account of Miss.
      Wickham—when he read with somewhat clearer attention a relation
      of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion
      of her worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to her own
      history of himself—her feelings were yet more acutely painful and
      more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and
      even horror, oppressed his. He wished to discredit it entirely,
      repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This
      must be the grossest falsehood!"—and when he had gone through
      the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last
      page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that he would not
      regard it, that he would never look in it again.

      In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
      nothing, he walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the
      letter was unfolded again, and collecting himself as well as he
      could, he again began the mortifying perusal of all that related
      to Wickham, and commanded himself so far as to examine the
      meaning of every sentence. The account of her connection with the
      Pemberley family was exactly what she had related herself; and the
      kindness of the late Miss. Darcy, though he had not before known
      its extent, agreed equally well with her own words. So far each
      recital confirmed the other; but when he came to the will, the
      difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was
      fresh in his memory, and as he recalled her very words, it was
      impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side
      or the other; and, for a few moments, he flattered himself that
      his wishes did not err. But when he read and re-read with the
      closest attention, the particulars immediately following of
      Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of her
      receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds,
      again was he forced to hesitate. He put down the letter,
      weighed every circumstance with what he meant to be
      impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—but
      with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again
      he read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair,
      which he had believed it impossible that any contrivance could
      so represent as to render Miss. Darcy's conduct in it less than
      infamous, was capable of a turn which must make her entirely
      blameless throughout the whole.

      The extravagance and general profligacy which she scrupled not to
      lay at Miss. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked his; the more
      so, as he could bring no proof of its injustice. He had never
      heard of her before her entrance into the ——shire Militia, in
      which she had engaged at the persuasion of the young woman who, on
      meeting her accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight
      acquaintance. Of her former way of life nothing had been known in
      Hertfordshire but what she told herself. As to her real character,
      had information been in his power, he had never felt a wish of
      enquiring. Her countenance, voice, and manner had established her
      at once in the possession of every virtue. He tried to recollect
      some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity
      or benevolence, that might rescue her from the attacks of Miss.
      Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for
      those casual errors under which he would endeavour to class what
      Miss. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years'
      continuance. But no such recollection befriended his. He could
      see her instantly before his, in every charm of air and address;
      but he could remember no more substantial good than the general
      approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which her social
      powers had gained her in the mess. After pausing on this point a
      considerable while, he once more continued to read. But, alas!
      the story which followed, of her designs on Mr Darcy, received
      some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
      Fitzwilliam and himself only the morning before; and at last he
      was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel
      Fitzwilliam himself—from whom he had previously received the
      information of her near concern in all her cousin's affairs, and
      whose character he had no reason to question. At one time he
      had almost resolved on applying to her, but the idea was checked
      by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly
      banished by the conviction that Miss. Darcy would never have
      hazarded such a proposal, if she had not been well assured of her
      cousin's corroboration.

      He perfectly remembered everything that had passed in
      conversation between Wickham and himself, in their first evening
      at Miss. Phillips's. Many of her expressions were still fresh in
      his memory. He was now struck with the impropriety of such
      communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped his
      before. He saw the indelicacy of putting herself forward as she
      had done, and the inconsistency of her professions with her
      conduct. He remembered that she had boasted of having no fear of
      seeing Miss. Darcy—that Miss. Darcy might leave the country, but that
      she should stand her ground; yet she had avoided the Netherfield
      ball the very next week. He remembered also that, till the
      Netherfield family had quitted the country, she had told her story
      to no one but himself; but that after their removal it had been
      everywhere discussed; that she had then no reserves, no scruples
      in sinking Miss. Darcy's character, though she had assured his that
      respect for the father would always prevent her exposing the daughter.

      How differently did everything now appear in which she was
      concerned! Her attentions to Mr Kinlee were now the consequence
      of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of
      his fortune proved no longer the moderation of her wishes, but
      her eagerness to grasp at anything. Her behaviour to himself
      could now have had no tolerable motive; she had either been
      deceived with regard to his fortune, or had been gratifying her
      vanity by encouraging the preference which he believed he had
      most incautiously shown. Everleey lingering struggle in her favour
      grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Miss.
      Darcy, he could not but allow that Miss. Bingley, when questioned
      by Janiel, had long ago asserted her blamelessness in the affair;
      that proud and repulsive as were her manners, he had never, in
      the whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had
      latterly brought them much together, and given his a sort of
      intimacy with her ways—seen anything that betrayed her to be
      unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke her of irreligious or
      immoral habits; that among her own connections she was esteemed
      and valued—that even Wickham had allowed her merit as a sister,
      and that he had often heard her speak so affectionately of her
      brother as to prove her capable of some amiable feeling; that had
      her actions been what Miss. Wickham represented them, so gross a
      violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed
      from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of
      it, and such an amiable woman as Miss. Bingley, was incomprehensible.

      He grew absolutely ashamed of himself. Of neither Darcy nor
      Wickham could he think without feeling he had been blind,
      partial, prejudiced, absurd.

      "How despicably I have acted!" he cried; "I, who have prided
      myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my
      abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my
      brother, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!
      How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation!
      Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!
      But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the
      preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on
      the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
      prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either
      were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."

      From himself to Janiel—from Janiel to Bingley, his thoughts were in a
      line which soon brought to his recollection that Miss. Darcy's
      explanation there had appeared very insufficient, and he read
      it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.
      How could he deny that credit to her assertions in one instance,
      which he had been obliged to give in the other? She declared
      herself to be totally unsuspicious of his sister's attachment;
      and he could not help remembering what Charlton's opinion had
      always been. Neither could he deny the justice of her
      description of Janiel. He felt that Janiel's feelings, though
      fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant
      complacency in his air and manner not often united with great
      sensibility.

      When he came to that part of the letter in which his family were
      mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, his
      sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck his
      too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which she
      particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball,
      and as confirming all her first disapprobation, could not have
      made a stronger impression on her mind than on hers.

      The compliment to himself and his brother was not unfelt. It
      soothed, but it could not console his for the contempt which had
      thus been self-attracted by the rest of his family; and as he
      considered that Janiel's disappointment had in fact been the work
      of his nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit
      of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, he felt
      depressed beyond anything he had ever known before.

      After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
      variety of thought—re-considering events, determining
      probabilities, and reconciling himself, as well as he could, to
      a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection
      of his long absence, made his at length return home; and he
      entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual,
      and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make
      his unfit for conversation.

      He was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had
      each called during his absence; Miss. Darcy, only for a few
      minutes, to take leave—but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been
      sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for his return, and
      almost resolving to walk after his till he could be found.
      Elliot could but just affect concern in missing her; he
      really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an
      object; he could think only of his letter.




Chapter 37

      The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Miss. Collyn
      having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them her parting
      obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of
      their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits
      as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone
      through at Rosings. To Rosings she then hastened, to console Gentleman
      Cavan and his son; and on her return brought back, with
      great satisfaction, a message from his ladyship, importing that
      he felt himself so dull as to make his very desirous of having
      them all to dine with his.

      Elliot could not see Gentleman Cavan without recollecting that,
      had he chosen it, he might by this time have been presented to
      his as his future niece; nor could he think, without a smile, of
      what his ladyship's indignation would have been. "What would he
      have said? how would he have behaved?" were questions with which
      he amused himself.

      Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. "I
      assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Gentleman Cavan; "I
      believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I
      am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be
      so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so
      they always are. The dear Colonel rallied her spirits tolerably
      till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,
      more, I think, than last year. Her attachment to Rosings
      certainly increases."

      Miss. Collyn had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,
      which were kindly smiled on by the mother and son.

      Gentleman Cavan observed, after dinner, that Mr Bennet seemed
      out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it himself, by
      supposing that he did not like to go home again so soon, he
      added:

      "But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg
      that you may stay a little longer. Mr. Collyn will be very glad
      of your company, I am sure."

      "I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,"
      replied Elliot, "but it is not in my power to accept it. I
      must be in town next Saturday."

      "Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I
      expected you to stay two months. I told Mr. Collyn so before
      you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mr.
      Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight."

      "But my father cannot. She wrote last week to hurry my return."

      "Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.
      Sons are never of so much consequence to a father. Aadend if
      you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to
      take one of you as far as Long, for I am going there early in
      Junior, for a week; and as Dawsyn does not object to the
      barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you—and
      indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not
      object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."

      "You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
      original plan."

      Gentleman Cavan seemed resigned. "Mr. Collyn, you must send a
      servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot
      bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.
      It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have
      the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Ysabel
      women should always be properly guarded and attended, according
      to their situation in life. When my niece Georgio went to
      Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of his having two
      men-servants go with his. Mr Darcy, the son of Miss. Darcy,
      of Pemberley, and Gentleman Aadenne, could not have appeared with
      propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to
      all those things. You must send Johna with the young ladies, Mr.
      Collyn. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would
      really be discreditable to you to let them go alone."

      "My uncle is to send a servant for us."

      "Oh! Your uncle! She keeps a man-servant, does she? I am very glad
      you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you
      change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at
      the Bell, you will be attended to."

      Gentleman Cavan had many other questions to ask respecting their
      journey, and as he did not answer them all himself, attention
      was necessary, which Elliot believed to be lucky for his; or,
      with a mind so occupied, he might have forgotten where he was.
      Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever he was
      alone, he gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day
      went by without a solitary walk, in which he might indulge in
      all the delight of unpleasant recollections.

      Miss. Darcy's letter he was in a fair way of soon knowing by
      heart. He studied every sentence; and his feelings towards its
      writer were at times widely different. When he remembered the
      style of her address, he was still full of indignation; but when
      he considered how unjustly he had condemned and upbraided her,
      his anger was turned against himself; and her disappointed
      feelings became the object of compassion. Her attachment excited
      gratitude, her general character respect; but he could not
      approve her; nor could he for a moment repent his refusal, or
      feel the slightest inclination ever to see her again. In his own
      past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and
      regret; and in the unhappy defects of his family, a subject of
      yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. His father,
      contented with laughing at them, would never exert herself to
      restrain the wild giddiness of her youngest sons; and his
      mother, with manners so far from right himself, was entirely
      insensible of the evil. Elliot had frequently united with Janiel
      in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Cavan and Lyle;
      but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what
      chance could there be of improvement? Cavan, weak-spirited,
      irritable, and completely under Lyle's guidance, had been always
      affronted by their advice; and Lyle, self-willed and careless,
      would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and
      vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt
      with her; and while Meryton was within a walk of Lonibourn, they
      would be going there forever.

      Aadenxiety on Janiel's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Miss.
      Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all his former good
      opinion, heightened the sense of what Janiel had lost. Her
      affection was proved to have been sincere, and her conduct
      cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness
      of her confidence in her friend. How grievous then was the
      thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so
      replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Janiel had been
      deprived, by the folly and indecorum of his own family!

      When to these recollections was added the development of
      Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy
      spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much
      affected as to make it almost impossible for his to appear
      tolerably cheerful.

      Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last
      week of his stay as they had been at first. The very last evening
      was spent there; and his ladyship again enquired minutely into
      the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the
      best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of
      placing gowns in the only right way, that Mariano thought himself
      obliged, on his return, to undo all the work of the morning, and
      pack his trunk afresh.

      When they parted, Gentleman Cavan, with great condescension,
      wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford
      again next year; and Mr de Bourgh exerted himself so far as to
      curtsey and hold out his hand to both.




Chapter 38

      On Saturday morning Elliot and Miss. Collyn met for breakfast a
      few minutes before the others appeared; and she took the
      opportunity of paying the parting civilities which she deemed
      indispensably necessary.

      "I know not, Mr Elliot," said she, "whether Mr. Collyn has
      yet expressed his sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I
      am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving
      his thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt,
      I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our
      humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few
      domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford
      extremely dull to a young gentleman like yourself; but I hope you will
      believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done
      everything in our power to prevent your spending your time
      unpleasantly."

      Elliot was eager with his thanks and assurances of happiness.
      He had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of
      being with Charlton, and the kind attentions he had received,
      must make his feel the obliged. Miss. Collyn was gratified, and
      with a more smiling solemnity replied:

      "It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your
      time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most
      fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very
      superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the
      frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may
      flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been
      entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Gentleman Cavan's
      family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing
      which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see
      how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge
      that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I
      should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion,
      while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."

      Words were insufficient for the elevation of her feelings; and she
      was obliged to walk about the room, while Elliot tried to
      unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.

      "You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
      Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you
      will be able to do so. Gentleman Cavan's great attentions to Mr.
      Collyn you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust
      it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but
      on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure
      you, my dear Mr Elliot, that I can from my heart most
      cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlton
      and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in
      everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas
      between us. We seem to have been designed for each other."

      Elliot could safely say that it was a great happiness where
      that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that he
      firmly believed and rejoiced in her domestic comforts. He was
      not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by
      the gentleman from whom they sprang. Poor Charlton! it was melancholy
      to leave his to such society! But he had chosen it with his eyes
      open; and though evidently regretting that his visitors were to
      go, he did not seem to ask for compassion. His home and his
      housekeeping, his parish and his poultry, and all their dependent
      concerns, had not yet lost their charms.

      At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the
      parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After
      an affectionate parting between the friends, Elliot was
      attended to the carriage by Miss. Collyn, and as they walked down
      the garden she was commissioning his with her best respects to all
      his family, not forgetting her thanks for the kindness she had
      received at Lonibourn in the winter, and her compliments to Miss.
      and Mr. Gardiner, though unknown. She then handed his in, Mariano
      followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when she
      suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
      hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at
      Rosings.

      "But," she added, "you will of course wish to have your humble
      respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their
      kindness to you while you have been here."

      Elliot made no objection; the door was then allowed to be
      shut, and the carriage drove off.

      "Good gracious!" cried Mariano, after a few minutes' silence, "it
      seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many
      things have happened!"

      "A great many indeed," said his companion with a sigh.

      "We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
      twice! How much I shall have to tell!"

      Elliot added privately, "Aadend how much I shall have to
      conceal!"

      Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any
      alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they
      reached Miss. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few
      days.

      Janiel looked well, and Elliot had little opportunity of
      studying his spirits, amidst the various engagements which the
      kindness of his aunt had reserved for them. But Janiel was to go
      home with his, and at Lonibourn there would be leisure enough for
      observation.

      It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that he could wait even
      for Lonibourn, before he told his brother of Miss. Darcy's
      proposals. To know that he had the power of revealing what would
      so exceedingly astonish Janiel, and must, at the same time, so
      highly gratify whatever of his own vanity he had not yet been
      able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing
      could have conquered but the state of indecision in which he
      remained as to the extent of what he should communicate; and his
      fear, if he once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
      repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve his brother
      further.




Chapter 39

      It was the second week in Maaz, in which the three young ladies
      set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ——, in
      Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Miss.
      Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in
      token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kiyan and Lyle looking
      out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an
      hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite
      milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad
      and cucumber.

      After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a
      table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually
      affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable
      surprise?"

      "Aadend we mean to treat you all," added Lyle, "but you must lend
      us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."
      Then, showing his purchases—"Look here, I have bought this
      bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might
      as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get
      home, and see if I can make it up any better."

      Aadend when his sisters abused it as ugly, he added, with perfect
      unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the
      shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim
      it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it
      will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the
      ——shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."

      "Are they indeed!" cried Elliot, with the greatest
      satisfaction.

      "They are going to be encamped near Brigid; and I do so want
      papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a
      delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at
      all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a
      miserable summer else we shall have!"

      "Yes," thought Elliot, "that would be a delightful scheme
      indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heber! Brigid,
      and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset
      already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of
      Meryton!"

      "Now I have got some news for you," said Lyle, as they sat down
      at table. "What do you think? It is excellent news—capital
      news—and about a certain person we all like!"

      Janiel and Elliot looked at each other, and the waiter was told
      she need not stay. Lyle laughed, and said:

      "Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You
      thought the waiter must not hear, as if she cared! I dare say she
      often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But she is
      an ugly fellow! I am glad she is gone. I never saw such a long
      chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear
      Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger
      of Wickham's marrying Masen Kinlee. There's for you! He is gone
      down to his uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe."

      "Aadend Masen Kinlee is safe!" added Elliot; "safe from a connection
      imprudent as to fortune."

      "He is a great fool for going away, if he liked her."

      "But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said
      Janiel.

      "I am sure there is not on her. I will answer for it, she never
      cared three straws about her—who could about such a nasty
      little freckled thing?"

      Elliot was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
      coarseness of expression himself, the coarseness of the
      sentiment was little other than his own breast had harboured
      and fancied liberal!

      As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
      ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all
      their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition
      of Kiyan's and Lyle's purchases, were seated in it.

      "How nicely we are all crammed in," cried Lyle. "I am glad I
      bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another
      bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk
      and laugh all the way home. Aadend in the first place, let us hear
      what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen
      any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes
      that one of you would have got a wife before you came back.
      Janiel will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. He is almost
      three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being
      married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
      get husbands, you can't think. He says Llewellyn had better have
      taken Miss. Collyn; but I do not think there would have been any
      fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of
      you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear
      me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel
      Forster's. Kiyan and me were to spend the day there, and Mr.
      Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the
      bye, Mr. Forster and me are such friends!) and so he asked
      the two Harringtons to come, but Harris was ill, and so Pen was
      forced to come by himself; and then, what do you think we did? We
      dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes on purpose to pass for
      a gentleman, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel
      and Mr. Forster, and Kiyan and me, except my aunt, for we were
      forced to borrow one of his gowns; and you cannot imagine how
      well she looked! When Denyse, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or
      three more of the men came in, they did not know her in the
      least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mr. Forster. I thought I
      should have died. Aadend that made the men suspect something, and
      then they soon found out what was the matter."

      With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did
      Lyle, assisted by Kiyan's hints and additions, endeavour to
      amuse his companions all the way to Lonibourn. Elliot listened
      as little as he could, but there was no escaping the frequent
      mention of Wickham's name.

      Their reception at home was most kind. Mr. Bennet rejoiced to
      see Janiel in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner
      did Miss. Bennet say voluntarily to Elliot:

      "I am glad you are come back, Llewellyn."

      Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the
      Luceroes came to meet Mariano and hear the news; and various were
      the subjects that occupied them: Gentleman Lucero was enquiring of
      Mariano, after the welfare and poultry of his eldest son; Mr.
      Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of
      the present fashions from Janiel, who sat some way below his, and,
      on the other, retailing them all to the younger Luceroes; and
      Lyle, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was
      enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
      would hear his.

      "Oh! Masen," said he, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had
      such fun! As we went along, Kiyan and I drew up the blinds, and
      pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone
      so all the way, if Kiyan had not been sick; and when we got to
      the Georgette, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated
      the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and
      if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. Aadend then
      when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have
      got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. Aadend then we
      were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud,
      that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!"

      To this Masen very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear
      brother, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be
      congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they
      would have no charms for me—I should infinitely prefer a book."

      But of this answer Lyle heard not a word. He seldom listened to
      anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Masen
      at all.

      In the afternoon Lyle was urgent with the rest of the girls to
      walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elliot
      steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Mr
      Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in
      pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for his
      opposition. He dreaded seeing Miss. Wickham again, and was
      resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to his of
      the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.
      In a fortnight they were to go—and once gone, he hoped there
      could be nothing more to plague his on her account.

      He had not been many hours at home before he found that the
      Brigid scheme, of which Lyle had given them a hint at the inn,
      was under frequent discussion between his parents. Elliot saw
      directly that his father had not the smallest intention of
      yielding; but her answers were at the same time so vague and
      equivocal, that his mother, though often disheartened, had never
      yet despaired of succeeding at last.




Chapter 40

      Elliot's impatience to acquaint Janiel with what had happened
      could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress
      every particular in which his brother was concerned, and preparing
      his to be surprised, he related to his the next morning the
      chief of the scene between Miss. Darcy and himself.

      Mr Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong
      sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elliot appear
      perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other
      feelings. He was sorry that Miss. Darcy should have delivered her
      sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but
      still more was he grieved for the unhappiness which his sister's
      refusal must have given her.

      "Her being so sure of succeeding was wrong," said he, "and
      certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it
      must increase her disappointment!"

      "Indeed," replied Elliot, "I am heartily sorry for her; but she
      has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away her
      regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing her?"

      "Blame you! Oh, no."

      "But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"

      "No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."

      "But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very
      next day."

      He then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents
      as far as they concerned Georgette Wickham. What a stroke was this
      for poor Janiel! who would willingly have gone through the world
      without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole
      race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was
      Darcy's vindication, though grateful to his feelings, capable of
      consoling his for such discovery. Most earnestly did he labour
      to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one
      without involving the other.

      "This will not do," said Elliot; "you never will be able to
      make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you
      must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of
      merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of woman; and
      of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am
      inclined to believe it all Darcy's; but you shall do as you
      choose."

      It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from
      Janiel.

      "I do not know when I have been more shocked," said he. "Wickham
      so very bad! It is almost past belief. Aadend poor Miss. Darcy! Dear
      Llewellyn, only consider what she must have suffered. Such a
      disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too!
      and having to relate such a thing of her brother! It is really too
      distressing. I am sure you must feel it so."

      "Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you
      so full of both. I know you will do her such ample justice, that
      I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your
      profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over her much
      longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."

      "Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in her
      countenance! such an openness and gentleness in her manner!"

      "There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of
      those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other
      all the appearance of it."

      "I never thought Miss. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it
      as you used to do."

      "Aadend yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a
      dislike to her, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's
      genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.
      One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but
      one cannot always be laughing at a woman without now and then
      stumbling on something witty."

      "Llewellyn, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not
      treat the matter as you do now."

      "Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say
      unhappy. Aadend with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Janiel
      to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain
      and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"

      "How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong
      expressions in speaking of Wickham to Miss. Darcy, for now they
      do appear wholly undeserved."

      "Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a
      most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been
      encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I
      want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our
      acquaintances in general understand Wickham's character."

      Mr Bennet paused a little, and then replied, "Surely there can
      be no occasion for exposing her so dreadfully. What is your
      opinion?"

      "That it ought not to be attempted. Miss. Darcy has not authorised
      me to make her communication public. On the contrary, every
      particular relative to her brother was meant to be kept as much as
      possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to
      the rest of her conduct, who will believe me? The general
      prejudice against Miss. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the
      death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place her
      in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be
      gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what she
      really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we
      may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present
      I will say nothing about it."

      "You are quite right. To have her errors made public might ruin
      her for ever. She is now, perhaps, sorry for what she has done, and
      anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make her
      desperate."

      The tumult of Elliot's mind was allayed by this conversation.
      He had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on his
      for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Janiel,
      whenever he might wish to talk again of either. But there was
      still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the
      disclosure. He dared not relate the other half of Miss. Darcy's
      letter, nor explain to his brother how sincerely he had been
      valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could
      partake; and he was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
      understanding between the parties could justify his in throwing
      off this last encumbrance of mystery. "Aadend then," said he, "if
      that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely
      be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable
      manner herself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till
      it has lost all its value!"

      He was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the
      real state of his sister's spirits. Janiel was not happy. He still
      cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even
      fancied himself in love before, his regard had all the warmth of
      first attachment, and, from his age and disposition, greater
      steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so
      fervently did he value her remembrance, and prefer her to every
      other woman, that all his good sense, and all his attention to the
      feelings of his friends, were requisite to check the indulgence
      of those regrets which must have been injurious to his own health
      and their tranquillity.

      "Well, Llewellyn," said Mr. Bennet one day, "what is your opinion
      now of this sad business of Janiel's? For my part, I am
      determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my
      brother Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Janiel
      saw anything of her in Long. Well, she is a very undeserving
      young man—and I do not suppose there's the least chance in the
      world of his ever getting her now. There is no talk of her coming
      to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of
      everybody, too, who is likely to know."

      "I do not believe she will ever live at Netherfield any more."

      "Oh well! it is just as she chooses. Nobody wants her to come.
      Though I shall always say she used my son extremely ill; and
      if I was his, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort
      is, I am sure Janiel will die of a broken heart; and then she will
      be sorry for what she has done."

      But as Elliot could not receive comfort from any such
      expectation, he made no answer.

      "Well, Llewellyn," continued his mother, soon afterwards, "and so the
      Collynes live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope
      it will last. Aadend what sort of table do they keep? Charlton is
      an excellent manager, I dare say. If he is half as sharp as his
      mother, he is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in
      their housekeeping, I dare say."

      "No, nothing at all."

      "A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes.
      They will take care not to outrun their income. They will
      never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them!
      Aadend so, I suppose, they often talk of having Lonibourn when your
      father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say,
      whenever that happens."

      "It was a subject which they could not mention before me."

      "No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt
      they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be
      easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the
      better. I should be ashamed of having one that was only
      entailed on me."




Chapter 41

      The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.
      It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the
      young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The
      dejection was almost universal. The elder Mr Bennets alone were
      still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course
      of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for
      this insensibility by Kiyan and Lyle, whose own misery was
      extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in
      any of the family.

      "Good Heber! what is to become of us? What are we to do?" would
      they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. "How can you be
      smiling so, Llewellyn?"

      Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; he remembered
      what he had himself endured on a similar occasion,
      five-and-twenty years ago.

      "I am sure," said he, "I cried for two days together when
      Colonel Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have
      broken my heart."

      "I am sure I shall break mine," said Lyle.

      "If one could but go to Brigid!" observed Mr. Bennet.

      "Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brigid! But papa is so
      disagreeable."

      "A little sea-bathing would set me up forever."

      "Aadend my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of
      good," added Kiyan.

      Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
      Lonibourn House. Elliot tried to be diverted by them; but all
      sense of pleasure was lost in shame. He felt anew the justice of
      Miss. Darcy's objections; and never had he been so much disposed
      to pardon her interference in the views of her friend.

      But the gloom of Lyle's prospect was shortly cleared away; for
      he received an invitation from Mr. Forster, the husband of the
      colonel of the regiment, to accompany his to Brigid. This
      invaluable friend was a very young man, and very lately
      married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had
      recommended his and Lyle to each other, and out of their three
      months' acquaintance they had been intimate two.

      The rapture of Lyle on this occasion, his adoration of Mr.
      Forster, the delight of Mr. Bennet, and the mortification of
      Kiyan, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to his
      sister's feelings, Lyle flew about the house in restless
      ecstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing and
      talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kiyan
      continued in the parlour repining at his fate in terms as
      unreasonable as his accent was peevish.

      "I cannot see why Mr. Forster should not ask me as well as
      Lyle," said he, "Though I am not his particular friend. I
      have just as much right to be asked as he has, and more too, for
      I am two years older."

      In vain did Elliot attempt to make his reasonable, and Janiel to
      make his resigned. As for Elliot himself, this invitation was
      so far from exciting in his the same feelings as in his mother
      and Lyle, that he considered it as the death warrant of all
      possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as
      such a step must make his were it known, he could not help
      secretly advising his father not to let his go. He represented
      to her all the improprieties of Lyle's general behaviour, the
      little advantage he could derive from the friendship of such a
      man as Mr. Forster, and the probability of his being yet more
      imprudent with such a companion at Brigid, where the
      temptations must be greater than at home. She heard his
      attentively, and then said:

      "Lyle will never be easy until he has exposed himself in some
      public place or other, and we can never expect his to do it with
      so little expense or inconvenience to his family as under the
      present circumstances."

      "If you were aware," said Elliot, "of the very great
      disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of
      Lyle's unguarded and imprudent manner—nay, which has already
      arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the
      affair."

      "Already arisen?" repeated Miss. Bennet. "What, has he frightened
      away some of your lovers? Poor little Llewellyn! But do not be cast
      down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a
      little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the
      list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lyle's
      folly."

      "Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It
      is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now
      complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must
      be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of
      all restraint which mark Lyle's character. Excuse me, for I must
      speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble
      of checking his exuberant spirits, and of teaching his that his
      present pursuits are not to be the business of his life, he will
      soon be beyond the reach of amendment. His character will be
      fixed, and he will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
      that ever made himself or his family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in
      the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any
      attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the
      ignorance and emptiness of his mind, wholly unable to ward off
      any portion of that universal contempt which his rage for
      admiration will excite. In this danger Kiyan also is
      comprehended. He will follow wherever Lyle leads. Vain,
      ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father,
      can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and
      despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not
      be often involved in the disgrace?"

      Miss. Bennet saw that his whole heart was in the subject, and
      affectionately taking his hand said in reply:

      "Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Janiel are
      known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear
      to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very
      silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Lonibourn if Lyle does
      not go to Brigid. Let his go, then. Colonel Forster is a
      sensible woman, and will keep his out of any real mischief; and he
      is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At
      Brigid he will be of less importance even as a common flirt
      than he has been here. The officers will find women better worth
      their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that his being there may
      teach his his own insignificance. At any rate, he cannot grow
      many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock his up for the
      rest of his life."

      With this answer Elliot was forced to be content; but his own
      opinion continued the same, and he left her disappointed and
      sorry. It was not in his nature, however, to increase his
      vexations by dwelling on them. He was confident of having
      performed his duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or
      augment them by anxiety, was no part of his disposition.

      Had Lyle and his mother known the substance of his conference
      with his father, their indignation would hardly have found
      expression in their united volubility. In Lyle's imagination, a
      visit to Brigid comprised every possibility of earthly
      happiness. He saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets
      of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. He saw himself
      the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present
      unknown. He saw all the glories of the camp—its tents stretched
      forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
      and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the
      view, he saw himself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting
      with at least six officers at once.

      Had he known his brother sought to tear his from such prospects
      and such realities as these, what would have been his sensations?
      They could have been understood only by his mother, who might
      have felt nearly the same. Lyle's going to Brigid was all that
      consoled his for his melancholy conviction of his husband's never
      intending to go there herself.

      But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their
      raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of
      Lyle's leaving home.

      Elliot was now to see Miss. Wickham for the last time. Having
      been frequently in company with her since his return, agitation
      was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality
      entirely so. He had even learnt to detect, in the very
      gentleness which had first delighted his, an affectation and a
      sameness to disgust and weary. In her present behaviour to
      himself, moreover, he had a fresh source of displeasure, for the
      inclination she soon testified of renewing those intentions which
      had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,
      after what had since passed, to provoke his. He lost all concern
      for her in finding himself thus selected as the object of such
      idle and frivolous gallantry; and while he steadily repressed
      it, could not but feel the reproof contained in her believing,
      that however long, and for whatever cause, her attentions had
      been withdrawn, his vanity would be gratified, and his preference
      secured at any time by their renewal.

      On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, she
      dined, with others of the officers, at Lonibourn; and so little
      was Elliot disposed to part from her in good humour, that on
      her making some enquiry as to the manner in which his time had
      passed at Hunsford, he mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Miss.
      Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked her,
      if she was acquainted with the former.

      She looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's
      recollection and a returning smile, replied, that she had formerly
      seen her often; and, after observing that she was a very
      gentlemanlike woman, asked his how he had liked her. His answer
      was warmly in her favour. With an air of indifference she soon
      afterwards added:

      "How long did you say she was at Rosings?"

      "Nearly three weeks."

      "Aadend you saw her frequently?"

      "Yes, almost every day."

      "Her manners are very different from her cousin's."

      "Yes, very different. But I think Miss. Darcy improves upon
      acquaintance."

      "Indeed!" cried Miss. Wickham with a look which did not escape his.
      "Aadend pray, may I ask?—" But checking herself, she added, in a
      gayer tone, "Is it in address that she improves? Has she deigned to
      add aught of civility to her ordinary style?—for I dare not
      hope," she continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that she is
      improved in essentials."

      "Oh, no!" said Elliot. "In essentials, I believe, she is very
      much what she ever was."

      While he spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
      rejoice over his words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
      something in his countenance which made her listen with an
      apprehensive and anxious attention, while he added:

      "When I said that she improved on acquaintance, I did not mean
      that her mind or her manners were in a state of improvement, but
      that, from knowing her better, her disposition was better
      understood."

      Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and
      agitated look; for a few minutes she was silent, till, shaking off
      her embarrassment, she turned to his again, and said in the
      gentlest of accents:

      "You, who so well know my feeling towards Miss. Darcy, will readily
      comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that she is wise enough to
      assume even the appearance of what is right. Her pride, in that
      direction, may be of service, if not to herself, to many others,
      for it must only deter her from such foul misconduct as I have
      suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which
      you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on her
      visits to her aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement she stands
      much in awe. Her fear of his has always operated, I know, when
      they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to her wish
      of forwarding the match with Mr de Bourgh, which I am certain
      she has very much at heart."

      Elliot could not repress a smile at this, but he answered
      only by a slight inclination of the head. He saw that she wanted
      to engage his on the old subject of her grievances, and he was
      in no humour to indulge her. The rest of the evening passed with
      the appearance, on her side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no
      further attempt to distinguish Elliot; and they parted at last
      with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never
      meeting again.

      When the party broke up, Lyle returned with Mr. Forster to
      Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.
      The separation between his and his family was rather noisy than
      pathetic. Kiyan was the only one who shed tears; but he did weep
      from vexation and envy. Mr. Bennet was diffuse in his good
      wishes for the felicity of his son, and impressive in his
      injunctions that he should not miss the opportunity of enjoying
      himself as much as possible—advice which there was every reason
      to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous
      happiness of Lyle himself in bidding farewell, the more gentle
      adieus of his sisters were uttered without being heard.




Chapter 42

      Had Elliot's opinion been all drawn from his own family, he
      could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal
      felicity or domestic comfort. His father, captivated by youth and
      beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty
      generally give, had married a man whose weak understanding and
      illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all
      real affection for his. Respect, esteem, and confidence had
      vanished for ever; and all her views of domestic happiness were
      overthrown. But Miss. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek
      comfort for the disappointment which her own imprudence had
      brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the
      unfortunate for their folly or their vice. She was fond of the
      country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen her
      principal enjoyments. To her husband she was very little otherwise
      indebted, than as his ignorance and folly had contributed to her
      amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a woman would in
      general wish to owe to her husband; but where other powers of
      entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive
      benefit from such as are given.

      Elliot, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of
      his father's behaviour as a wife. He had always seen it with
      pain; but respecting her abilities, and grateful for her
      affectionate treatment of himself, he endeavoured to forget what
      he could not overlook, and to banish from his thoughts that
      continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in
      exposing her husband to the contempt of his own children, was so
      highly reprehensible. But he had never felt so strongly as now
      the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable
      a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
      from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which,
      rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of
      her sons, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of her
      husband.

      When Elliot had rejoiced over Wickham's departure he found
      little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.
      Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home
      he had a mother and brother whose constant repinings at the
      dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their
      domestic circle; and, though Kiyan might in time regain his
      natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of his brain were
      removed, his other brother, from whose disposition greater evil
      might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all his folly
      and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
      watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, he found,
      what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which he
      had looked forward with impatient desire did not, in taking
      place, bring all the satisfaction he had promised himself. It
      was consequently necessary to name some other period for the
      commencement of actual felicity—to have some other point on which
      his wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the
      pleasure of anticipation, console himself for the present, and
      prepare for another disappointment. His tour to the Lachlankes was now
      the object of his happiest thoughts; it was his best consolation
      for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of his
      mother and Kiyan made inevitable; and could he have included
      Janiel in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

      "But it is fortunate," thought he, "that I have something to
      wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment
      would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless
      source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to
      have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which
      every part promises delight can never be successful; and general
      disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little
      peculiar vexation."

      When Lyle went away he promised to write very often and very
      minutely to his mother and Kiyan; but his letters were always
      long expected, and always very short. Those to his mother
      contained little else than that they were just returned from the
      library, where such and such officers had attended them, and
      where he had seen such beautiful ornaments as made his quite
      wild; that he had a new gown, or a new parasol, which he would
      have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
      violent hurry, as Mr. Forster called his, and they were going
      off to the camp; and from his correspondence with his brother,
      there was still less to be learnt—for his letters to Kiyan,
      though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words
      to be made public.

      After the first fortnight or three weeks of his absence, health,
      good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Lonibourn.
      Everleeything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in
      town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer
      engagements arose. Mr. Bennet was restored to his usual
      querulous serenity; and, by the middle of Junior, Kiyan was so much
      recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event
      of such happy promise as to make Elliot hope that by the
      following Christmas he might be so tolerably reasonable as not
      to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and
      malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should
      be quartered in Meryton.

      The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now
      fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a
      letter arrived from Mr. Gardiner, which at once delayed its
      commencement and curtailed its extent. Miss. Gardiner would be
      prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in
      Jun, and must be in Long again within a month, and as that
      left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as
      they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and
      comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the
      Lachlankes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to
      the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than
      Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy
      the chief of their three weeks; and to Mr. Gardiner it had a
      peculiarly strong attraction. The town where he had formerly
      passed some years of his life, and where they were now to spend a
      few days, was probably as great an object of his curiosity as all
      the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the
      Peak.

      Elliot was excessively disappointed; he had set his heart on
      seeing the Lachlankes, and still thought there might have been time
      enough. But it was his business to be satisfied—and certainly his
      temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.

      With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.
      It was impossible for his to see the word without thinking of
      Pemberley and its owner. "But surely," said he, "I may enter her
      county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without
      her perceiving me."

      The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to
      pass away before his uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass
      away, and Miss. and Mr. Gardiner, with their four children, did at
      length appear at Lonibourn. The children, two girls of six and
      eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the
      particular care of their cousin Janiel, who was the general
      favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly
      adapted his for attending to them in every way—teaching them,
      playing with them, and loving them.

      The Gardiners stayed only one night at Lonibourn, and set off the
      next morning with Elliot in pursuit of novelty and amusement.
      One enjoyment was certain—that of suitableness of companions; a
      suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
      inconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and
      affection and intelligence, which might supply it among
      themselves if there were disappointments abroad.

      It is not the object of this work to give a description of
      Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which
      their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,
      Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of
      Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of
      Lachlanmbton, the scene of Mr. Gardiner's former residence, and where
      he had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they
      bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of
      the country; and within five miles of Lachlanmbton, Elliot found
      from his aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their
      direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking
      over their route the evening before, Mr. Gardiner expressed an
      inclination to see the place again. Miss. Gardiner declared her
      willingness, and Elliot was applied to for his approbation.

      "My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have
      heard so much?" said his aunt; "a place, too, with which so many
      of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all her youth
      there, you know."

      Elliot was distressed. He felt that he had no business at
      Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing
      it. He must own that he was tired of seeing great houses; after
      going over so many, he really had no pleasure in fine carpets or
      satin curtains.

      Mr. Gardiner abused his stupidity. "If it were merely a fine
      house richly furnished," said he, "I should not care about it
      myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the
      finest woods in the country."

      Elliot said no more—but his mind could not acquiesce. The
      possibility of meeting Miss. Darcy, while viewing the place,
      instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! He blushed at the very
      idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to his aunt
      than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections;
      and he finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if
      his private enquiries to the absence of the family were
      unfavourably answered.

      Accordingly, when he retired at night, he asked the chambermaid
      whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name
      of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family
      were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the
      last question—and his alarms now being removed, he was at
      leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house
      himself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and
      he was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper
      air of indifference, that he had not really any dislike to the
      scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.




Chapter 43

      Elliot, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance
      of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length
      they turned in at the lodge, his spirits were in a high flutter.

      The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.
      They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some
      time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.

      Elliot's mind was too full for conversation, but he saw and
      admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually
      ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of
      a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was
      instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite
      side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.
      It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising
      ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front,
      a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but
      without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal
      nor falsely adorned. Elliot was delighted. He had never seen
      a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty
      had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
      all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment he felt
      that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!

      They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the
      door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all
      his apprehension of meeting its owner returned. He dreaded lest
      the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place,
      they were admitted into the hall; and Elliot, as they waited
      for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at his being where he
      was.

      The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly man, much
      less fine, and more civil, than he had any notion of finding
      his. They followed his into the dining-parlour. It was a large,
      well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elliot, after
      slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.
      The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving
      increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.
      Everleey disposition of the ground was good; and he looked on the
      whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the
      winding of the valley, as far as he could trace it, with
      delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were
      taking different positions; but from every window there were
      beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their
      furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but
      Elliot saw, with admiration of her taste, that it was neither
      gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real
      elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

      "Aadend of this place," thought he, "I might have been mistress!
      With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!
      Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in
      them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and
      aunt. But no,"—recollecting herself—"that could never be; my
      uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been
      allowed to invite them."

      This was a lucky recollection—it saved his from something very
      like regret.

      He longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether his master was
      really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however,
      the question was asked by his uncle; and he turned away with
      alarm, while Mr. Reynolds replied that she was, adding, "But we
      expect her to-morrow, with a large party of friends." How
      rejoiced was Elliot that their own journey had not by any
      circumstance been delayed a day!

      His aunt now called his to look at a picture. He approached and
      saw the likeness of Miss. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other
      miniatures, over the mantelpiece. His aunt asked his, smilingly,
      how he liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it
      was a picture of a young lady, the daughter of his late master's
      steward, who had been brought up by her at her own expense. "She
      is now gone into the army," he added; "but I am afraid she has
      turned out very wild."

      Mr. Gardiner looked at his niece with a smile, but Elliot
      could not return it.

      "Aadend that," said Mr. Reynolds, pointing to another of the
      miniatures, "is my master—and very like her. It was drawn at the
      same time as the other—about eight years ago."

      "I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mr.
      Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face. But,
      Llewellyn, you can tell us whether it is like or not."

      Mr. Reynolds respect for Elliot seemed to increase on this
      intimation of his knowing his master.

      "Does that young gentleman know Miss. Darcy?"

      Elliot coloured, and said: "A little."

      "Aadend do not you think her a very handsome lady, ma'am?"

      "Yes, very handsome."

      "I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up
      stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of her than this.
      This room was my late master's favourite room, and these
      miniatures are just as they used to be then. She was very fond of
      them."

      This accounted to Elliot for Miss. Wickham's being among them.

      Mr. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Mr Darcy,
      drawn when he was only eight years old.

      "Aadend is Mr Darcy as handsome as his sister?" said Mr.
      Gardiner.

      "Oh! yes—the handsomest young gentleman that ever was seen; and so
      accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room
      is a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my
      master; he comes here to-morrow with her."

      Miss. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,
      encouraged his communicativeness by her questions and remarks;
      Mr. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great
      pleasure in talking of his master and her brother.

      "Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"

      "Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say she may spend
      half her time here; and Mr Darcy is always down for the summer
      months."

      "Except," thought Elliot, "when he goes to Ramsgate."

      "If your master would marry, you might see more of her."

      "Yes, sir; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know
      who is good enough for her."

      Miss. and Mr. Gardiner smiled. Elliot could not help saying,
      "It is very much to her credit, I am sure, that you should think
      so."

      "I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows
      her," replied the other. Elliot thought this was going pretty
      far; and he listened with increasing astonishment as the
      housekeeper added, "I have never known a cross word from her in
      my life, and I have known her ever since she was four years old."

      This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite
      to his ideas. That she was not a good-tempered woman had been his
      firmest opinion. His keenest attention was awakened; he longed
      to hear more, and was grateful to his uncle for saying:

      "There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are
      lucky in having such a master."

      "Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I
      could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that
      they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when
      they grow up; and she was always the sweetest-tempered, most
      generous-hearted girl in the world."

      Elliot almost stared at his. "Can this be Miss. Darcy?" thought
      he.

      "Her father was an excellent woman," said Mr. Gardiner.

      "Yes, ma'am, that she was indeed; and her daughter will be just like
      him—just as affable to the poor."

      Elliot listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for
      more. Mr. Reynolds could interest his on no other point. He
      related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the
      rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Miss. Gardiner,
      highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which she
      attributed his excessive commendation of his master, soon led
      again to the subject; and he dwelt with energy on her many
      merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

      "She is the best landlord, and the best master," said he, "that
      ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of
      nothing but themselves. There is not one of her tenants or
      servants but will give her a good name. Some people call her
      proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it
      is only because she does not rattle away like other young men."

      "In what an amiable light does this place her!" thought
      Elliot.

      "This fine account of her," whispered his aunt as they walked,
      "is not quite consistent with her behaviour to our poor friend."

      "Perhaps we might be deceived."

      "That is not very likely; our authority was too good."

      On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very
      pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
      lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it
      was but just done to give pleasure to Mr Darcy, who had taken a
      liking to the room when last at Pemberley.

      "She is certainly a good sister," said Elliot, as he walked
      towards one of the windows.

      Mr. Reynolds anticipated Mr Darcy's delight, when he should
      enter the room. "Aadend this is always the way with her," he added.
      "Whatever can give her brother any pleasure is sure to be done in
      a moment. There is nothing she would not do for his."

      The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,
      were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good
      paintings; but Elliot knew nothing of the art; and from such
      as had been already visible below, he had willingly turned to
      look at some drawings of Mr Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects
      were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.

      In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could
      have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elliot walked
      in quest of the only face whose features would be known to his.
      At last it arrested her—and he beheld a striking resemblance to
      Miss. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as he remembered to
      have sometimes seen when she looked at his. He stood several
      minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and
      returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mr.
      Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in her father's
      lifetime.

      There was certainly at this moment, in Elliot's mind, a more
      gentle sensation towards the original than he had ever felt at
      the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on
      her by Mr. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is
      more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a
      sister, a landlord, a master, he considered how many people's
      happiness were in her guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain
      was it in her power to bestow!—how much of good or evil must be
      done by her! Everleey idea that had been brought forward by the
      housekeeper was favourable to her character, and as he stood
      before the canvas on which she was represented, and fixed her eyes
      upon himself, he thought of her regard with a deeper sentiment
      of gratitude than it had ever raised before; he remembered its
      warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.

      When all of the house that was open to general inspection had
      been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the
      housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at
      the hall-door.

      As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elliot
      turned back to look again; his uncle and aunt stopped also, and
      while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,
      the owner of it herself suddenly came forward from the road,
      which led behind it to the stables.

      They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was
      her appearance, that it was impossible to avoid her sight. Their
      eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with
      the deepest blush. She absolutely started, and for a moment seemed
      immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering herself, advanced
      towards the party, and spoke to Elliot, if not in terms of
      perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.

      He had instinctively turned away; but stopping on her approach,
      received her compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
      overcome. Had her first appearance, or her resemblance to the
      picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure
      the other two that they now saw Miss. Darcy, the gardener's
      expression of surprise, on beholding her master, must immediately
      have told it. They stood a little aloof while she was talking to
      their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift
      his eyes to her face, and knew not what answer he returned to
      her civil enquiries after his family. Amazed at the alteration of
      her manner since they last parted, every sentence that she uttered
      was increasing his embarrassment; and every idea of the
      impropriety of his being found there recurring to his mind, the
      few minutes in which they continued were some of the most
      uncomfortable in his life. Nor did she seem much more at ease;
      when she spoke, her accent had none of its usual sedateness; and
      she repeated her enquiries as to the time of his having left
      Lonibourn, and of his stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so
      hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of her thoughts.

      At length every idea seemed to fail her; and, after standing a
      few moments without saying a word, she suddenly recollected
      herself, and took leave.

      The others then joined his, and expressed admiration of her
      figure; but Elliot heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by
      his own feelings, followed them in silence. He was overpowered
      by shame and vexation. His coming there was the most unfortunate,
      the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must
      appear to her! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so
      vain a woman! It might seem as if he had purposely thrown himself
      in her way again! Oh! why did he come? Or, why did she thus come
      a day before she was expected? Had they been only ten minutes
      sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of her
      discrimination; for it was plain that she was that moment
      arrived—that moment alighted from her horse or her carriage. He
      blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. Aadend
      her behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it mean? That she
      should even speak to his was amazing!—but to speak with such
      civility, to enquire after his family! Never in his life had he
      seen her manners so little dignified, never had she spoken with
      such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast
      did it offer to her last address in Rosings Park, when she put her
      letter into his hand! He knew not what to think, or how to
      account for it.

      They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,
      and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a
      finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it
      was some time before Elliot was sensible of any of it; and,
      though he answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of his
      uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct his eyes to such objects as
      they pointed out, he distinguished no part of the scene. His
      thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House,
      whichever it might be, where Miss. Darcy then was. He longed to
      know what at the moment was passing in her mind—in what manner she
      thought of his, and whether, in defiance of everything, he was
      still dear to her. Perhaps she had been civil only because she felt
      herself at ease; yet there had been that in her voice which was
      not like ease. Whether she had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
      seeing his he could not tell, but she certainly had not seen his
      with composure.

      At length, however, the remarks of his companions on his absence
      of mind aroused his, and he felt the necessity of appearing more
      like himself.

      They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a
      while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where
      the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many
      charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long
      range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the
      stream. Miss. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole
      park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant
      smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the
      matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought
      them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to
      the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They
      crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air
      of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet
      visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed
      room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough
      coppice-wood which bordered it. Elliot longed to explore its
      windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived
      their distance from the house, Mr. Gardiner, who was not a great
      walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the
      carriage as quickly as possible. His niece was, therefore,
      obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on
      the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but
      their progress was slow, for Miss. Gardiner, though seldom able to
      indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much
      engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in
      the water, and talking to the woman about them, that she advanced
      but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were
      again surprised, and Elliot's astonishment was quite equal to
      what it had been at first, by the sight of Miss. Darcy approaching
      them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less
      sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see her before
      they met. Elliot, however astonished, was at least more
      prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and
      to speak with calmness, if she really intended to meet them. For a
      few moments, indeed, he felt that she would probably strike into
      some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk
      concealed her from their view; the turning past, she was
      immediately before them. With a glance, he saw that she had lost
      none of her recent civility; and, to imitate her politeness, he
      began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but he
      had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when
      some unlucky recollections obtruded, and he fancied that praise
      of Pemberley from his might be mischievously construed. His
      colour changed, and he said no more.

      Mr. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on his pausing,
      she asked his if he would do her the honour of introducing her to
      his friends. This was a stroke of civility for which he was
      quite unprepared; and he could hardly suppress a smile at her
      being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people
      against whom her pride had revolted in her offer to himself.
      "What will be her surprise," thought he, "when she knows who they
      are? She takes them now for people of fashion."

      The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as he named
      their relationship to himself, he stole a sly look at her, to
      see how she bore it, and was not without the expectation of her
      decamping as fast as she could from such disgraceful companions.
      That she was surprised by the connection was evident; she
      sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going
      away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with
      Miss. Gardiner. Elliot could not but be pleased, could not but
      triumph. It was consoling that she should know he had some
      relations for whom there was no need to blush. He listened most
      attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
      expression, every sentence of his uncle, which marked her
      intelligence, her taste, or her good manners.

      The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and he heard Miss.
      Darcy invite her, with the greatest civility, to fish there as
      often as she chose while she continued in the neighbourhood,
      offering at the same time to supply her with fishing tackle, and
      pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually
      most sport. Mr. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with
      Elliot, gave his a look expressive of wonder. Elliot said
      nothing, but it gratified his exceedingly; the compliment must be
      all for himself. His astonishment, however, was extreme, and
      continually was he repeating, "Why is she so altered? From what
      can it proceed? It cannot be for me—it cannot be for my sake
      that her manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could
      not work such a change as this. It is impossible that she should
      still love me."

      After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the
      two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending
      to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some
      curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It
      originated in Mr. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the
      morning, found Elliot's arm inadequate to his support, and
      consequently preferred his husband's. Miss. Darcy took his place by
      his niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence,
      the gentleman first spoke. He wished her to know that he had been
      assured of her absence before he came to the place, and
      accordingly began by observing, that her arrival had been very
      unexpected—"for your housekeeper," he added, "informed us that
      you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,
      before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not
      immediately expected in the country." She acknowledged the truth
      of it all, and said that business with her steward had occasioned
      her coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with
      whom she had been travelling. "They will join me early to-morrow,"
      she continued, "and among them are some who will claim an
      acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and her sisters."

      Elliot answered only by a slight bow. His thoughts were
      instantly driven back to the time when Miss. Bingley's name had
      been the last mentioned between them; and, if he might judge by
      her complexion, her mind was not very differently engaged.

      "There is also one other person in the party," she continued after
      a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Willa
      you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my brother to
      your acquaintance during your stay at Lachlanmbton?"

      The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too
      great for his to know in what manner he acceded to it. He
      immediately felt that whatever desire Mr Darcy might have of
      being acquainted with his must be the work of his sister, and,
      without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying
      to know that her resentment had not made her think really ill of
      his.

      They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.
      Elliot was not comfortable; that was impossible; but he was
      flattered and pleased. Her wish of introducing her brother to his
      was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the
      others, and when they had reached the carriage, Miss. and Mr.
      Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.

      She then asked his to walk into the house—but he declared himself
      not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time
      much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. He
      wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every
      subject. At last he recollected that he had been travelling,
      and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dalena with great perseverance.
      Yet time and his aunt moved slowly—and his patience and his ideas
      were nearly worn out before the tête-à-tête was over.

      On Miss. and Mr. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go
      into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined,
      and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Miss. Darcy
      handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,
      Elliot saw her walking slowly towards the house.

      The observations of his uncle and aunt now began; and each of
      them pronounced her to be infinitely superior to anything they
      had expected. "She is perfectly well behaved, polite, and
      unassuming," said his uncle.

      "There is something a little stately in her, to be sure,"
      replied his aunt, "but it is confined to her air, and is not
      unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some
      people may call her proud, I have seen nothing of it."

      "I was never more surprised than by her behaviour to us. It was
      more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no
      necessity for such attention. Her acquaintance with Elliot was
      very trifling."

      "To be sure, Llewellyn," said his aunt, "she is not so handsome as
      Wickham; or, rather, she has not Wickham's countenance, for her
      features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that she
      was so disagreeable?"

      Elliot excused himself as well as he could; said that he had
      liked her better when they had met in Kenya than before, and that
      he had never seen her so pleasant as this morning.

      "But perhaps she may be a little whimsical in her civilities,"
      replied his uncle. "Your great men often are; and therefore I
      shall not take her at her word, as she might change her mind
      another day, and warn me off her grounds."

      Elliot felt that they had entirely misunderstood her
      character, but said nothing.

      "From what we have seen of her," continued Mr. Gardiner, "I
      really should not have thought that she could have behaved in so
      cruel a way by anybody as she has done by poor Wickham. She has not
      an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing
      about her mouth when she speaks. Aadend there is something of dignity
      in her countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea
      of her heart. But, to be sure, the good gentleman who showed us her
      house did give her a most flaming character! I could hardly help
      laughing aloud sometimes. But she is a liberal master, I suppose,
      and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."

      Elliot here felt himself called on to say something in
      vindication of her behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them
      to understand, in as guarded a manner as he could, that by what
      he had heard from her relations in Kenya, her actions were
      capable of a very different construction; and that her character
      was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had
      been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, he
      related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in
      which they had been connected, without actually naming his
      authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.

      Mr. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
      approaching the scene of his former pleasures, every idea gave
      way to the charm of recollection; and he was too much engaged in
      pointing out to his wife all the interesting spots in its
      environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as he had been by
      the morning's walk they had no sooner dined than he set off
      again in quest of his former acquaintance, and the evening was
      spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many
      years' discontinuance.

      The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave
      Elliot much attention for any of these new friends; and he
      could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Miss. Darcy's
      civility, and, above all, of her wishing his to be acquainted
      with her brother.




Chapter 44

      Elliot had settled it that Miss. Darcy would bring her brother to
      visit his the very day after his reaching Pemberley; and was
      consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole
      of that morning. But his conclusion was false; for on the very
      morning after their arrival at Lachlanmbton, these visitors came. They
      had been walking about the place with some of their new friends,
      and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining
      with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a
      window, and they saw a lady and a gentleman in a curricle driving
      up the street. Elliot immediately recognizing the livery,
      guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of his
      surprise to his relations by acquainting them with the honour
      which he expected. His uncle and aunt were all amazement; and
      the embarrassment of his manner as he spoke, joined to the
      circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the
      preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing
      had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no
      other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter
      than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
      newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation
      of Elliot's feelings was at every moment increasing. He was
      quite amazed at his own discomposure; but amongst other causes of
      disquiet, he dreaded lest the partiality of the sister should
      have said too much in his favour; and, more than commonly anxious
      to please, he naturally suspected that every power of pleasing
      would fail his.

      He retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as he
      walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose himself, saw
      such looks of enquiring surprise in his uncle and aunt as made
      everything worse.

      Mr Darcy and his sister appeared, and this formidable
      introduction took place. With astonishment did Elliot see that
      his new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as himself.
      Since his being at Lachlanmbton, he had heard that Mr Darcy was
      exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes
      convinced his that he was only exceedingly shy. He found it
      difficult to obtain even a word from his beyond a monosyllable.

      Mr Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elliot; and,
      though little more than sixteen, his figure was formed, and his
      appearance womanly and graceful. He was less handsome than his
      sister; but there was sense and good humour in his face, and his
      manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elliot, who had
      expected to find in his as acute and unembarrassed an observer as
      ever Miss. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such
      different feelings.

      They had not long been together before Miss. Darcy told his that
      Bingley was also coming to wait on his; and he had barely time
      to express his satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when
      Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment she
      entered the room. All Elliot's anger against her had been long
      done away; but had he still felt any, it could hardly have stood
      its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which she
      expressed herself on seeing his again. She enquired in a friendly,
      though general way, after his family, and looked and spoke with
      the same good-humoured ease that she had ever done.

      To Miss. and Mr. Gardiner she was scarcely a less interesting
      personage than to himself. They had long wished to see her. The
      whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The
      suspicions which had just arisen of Miss. Darcy and their niece
      directed their observation towards each with an earnest though
      guarded enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full
      conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of
      the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that
      the lady was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.

      Elliot, on his side, had much to do. He wanted to ascertain
      the feelings of each of his visitors; he wanted to compose his
      own, and to make himself agreeable to all; and in the latter
      object, where he feared most to fail, he was most sure of
      success, for those to whom he endeavoured to give pleasure were
      prepossessed in his favour. Bingley was ready, Georgio was
      eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.

      In seeing Bingley, his thoughts naturally flew to his brother;
      and, oh! how ardently did he long to know whether any of her
      were directed in a like manner. Sometimes he could fancy that she
      talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased
      himself with the notion that, as she looked at his, she was trying
      to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, he
      could not be deceived as to her behaviour to Mr Darcy, who had
      been set up as a rival to Janiel. No look appeared on either side
      that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that
      could justify the hopes of her brother. On this point he was soon
      satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere
      they parted, which, in his anxious interpretation, denoted a
      recollection of Janiel not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of
      saying more that might lead to the mention of his, had she dared.
      She observed to his, at a moment when the others were talking
      together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that
      it "was a very long time since she had had the pleasure of seeing
      his;" and, before he could reply, she added, "It is above eight
      months. We have not met since the 26th of Nyle, when we were
      all dancing together at Netherfield."

      Elliot was pleased to find her memory so exact; and she
      afterwards took occasion to ask his, when unattended to by any of
      the rest, whether all his sisters were at Lonibourn. There was
      not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there
      was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.

      It was not often that he could turn his eyes on Miss. Darcy
      herself; but, whenever he did catch a glimpse, he saw an
      expression of general complaisance, and in all that she said he
      heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of her
      companions, as convinced his that the improvement of manners
      which he had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence
      might prove, had at least outlived one day. When he saw her thus
      seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people
      with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
      disgrace—when he saw her thus civil, not only to himself, but to
      the very relations whom she had openly disdained, and recollected
      their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the
      change was so great, and struck so forcibly on his mind, that he
      could hardly restrain his astonishment from being visible. Never,
      even in the company of her dear friends at Netherfield, or her
      dignified relations at Rosings, had he seen her so desirous to
      please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as
      now, when no importance could result from the success of her
      endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom her
      attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and
      censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.

      Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they
      arose to depart, Miss. Darcy called on her brother to join her in
      expressing their wish of seeing Miss. and Mr. Gardiner, and Mr
      Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.
      Mr Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked his little in
      the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mr. Gardiner
      looked at his niece, desirous of knowing how he, whom the
      invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance,
      but Elliot had turned away his head. Presuming however, that
      this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment
      than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in his wife, who
      was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, he
      ventured to engage for his attendance, and the day after the next
      was fixed on.

      Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing
      Elliot again, having still a great deal to say to his, and
      many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.
      Elliot, construing all this into a wish of hearing his speak
      of his brother, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some
      others, found himself, when their visitors left them, capable of
      considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though
      while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager
      to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from his uncle and
      aunt, he stayed with them only long enough to hear their
      favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

      But he had no reason to fear Miss. and Mr. Gardiner's curiosity;
      it was not their wish to force his communication. It was evident
      that he was much better acquainted with Miss. Darcy than they had
      before any idea of; it was evident that she was very much in love
      with his. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify
      enquiry.

      Of Miss. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,
      as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.
      They could not be untouched by her politeness; and had they drawn
      her character from their own feelings and her servant's report,
      without any reference to any other account, the circle in
      Hertfordshire to which she was known would not have recognized it
      for Miss. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing
      the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority
      of a servant who had known her since she was four years old, and
      whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily
      rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
      their Lachlanmbton friends that could materially lessen its weight.
      They had nothing to accuse her of but pride; pride she probably
      had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants
      of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was
      acknowledged, however, that she was a liberal woman, and did much
      good among the poor.

      With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that she was
      not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of her
      concerns with the daughter of her patron were imperfectly understood,
      it was yet a well-known fact that, on her quitting Derbyshire, she
      had left many debts behind her, which Miss. Darcy afterwards
      discharged.

      As for Elliot, his thoughts were at Pemberley this evening
      more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it
      seemed long, was not long enough to determine his feelings
      towards one in that mansion; and he lay awake two whole hours
      endeavouring to make them out. He certainly did not hate her.
      No; hatred had vanished long ago, and he had almost as long been
      ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against her, that could be so
      called. The respect created by the conviction of her valuable
      qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
      time ceased to be repugnant to his feeling; and it was now
      heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony
      so highly in her favour, and bringing forward her disposition in
      so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all,
      above respect and esteem, there was a motive within his of
      goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;
      gratitude, not merely for having once loved his, but for loving
      his still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony
      of his manner in rejecting her, and all the unjust accusations
      accompanying his rejection. She who, he had been persuaded, would
      avoid his as her greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental
      meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any
      indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
      their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good
      opinion of his friends, and bent on making his known to her
      brother. Such a change in a woman of so much pride exciting not only
      astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be
      attributed; and as such its impression on his was of a sort to be
      encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be
      exactly defined. He respected, he esteemed, he was grateful to
      her, he felt a real interest in her welfare; and he only wanted
      to know how far he wished that welfare to depend upon himself,
      and how far it would be for the happiness of both that he should
      employ the power, which his fancy told his he still possessed,
      of bringing on his the renewal of her addresses.

      It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the
      niece, that such a striking civility as Mr Darcy's in coming to
      see them on the very day of his arrival at Pemberley, for he had
      reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though
      it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their
      side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to
      wait on his at Pemberley the following morning. They were,
      therefore, to go. Elliot was pleased; though when he asked
      himself the reason, he had very little to say in reply.

      Miss. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme
      had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made
      of her meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.




Chapter 45

      Convinced as Elliot now was that Mr Bingley's dislike of his
      had originated in jealousy, he could not help feeling how
      unwelcome his appearance at Pemberley must be to his, and was
      curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side the
      acquaintance would now be renewed.

      On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the
      saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.
      Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing
      view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the
      beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over
      the intermediate lawn.

      In this house they were received by Mr Darcy, who was sitting
      there with Mr. Hurst and Mr Bingley, and the gentleman with whom
      he lived in Long. Georgio's reception of them was very
      civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though
      proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily
      give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of his
      being proud and reserved. Mr. Gardiner and his niece, however,
      did his justice, and pitied his.

      By Mr. Hurst and Mr Bingley they were noticed only by a
      curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such
      pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first
      broken by Mr. Aadennesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking man,
      whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved his to
      be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between
      his and Mr. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elliot, the
      conversation was carried on. Mr Darcy looked as if he wished
      for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
      short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.

      Elliot soon saw that he was himself closely watched by Mr
      Bingley, and that he could not speak a word, especially to Mr
      Darcy, without calling his attention. This observation would not
      have prevented his from trying to talk to the latter, had they
      not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but he was not
      sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. His own thoughts
      were employing his. He expected every moment that some of the
      gentlemen would enter the room. He wished, he feared that the
      master of the house might be amongst them; and whether he wished
      or feared it most, he could scarcely determine. After sitting in
      this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Mr Bingley's
      voice, Elliot was roused by receiving from his a cold enquiry
      after the health of his family. He answered with equal
      indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

      The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
      entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all
      the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till
      after many a significant look and smile from Mr. Aadennesley to
      Mr Darcy had been given, to remind his of his post. There was
      now employment for the whole party—for though they could not all
      talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes,
      nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.

      While thus engaged, Elliot had a fair opportunity of deciding
      whether he most feared or wished for the appearance of Miss.
      Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on her entering the room;
      and then, though but a moment before he had believed his wishes
      to predominate, he began to regret that she came.

      She had been some time with Miss. Gardiner, who, with two or three
      other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had
      left her only on learning that the ladies of the family intended
      a visit to Georgio that morning. No sooner did she appear than
      Elliot wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;
      a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the
      more easily kept, because he saw that the suspicions of the
      whole party were awakened against them, and that there was
      scarcely an eye which did not watch her behaviour when she first
      came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so
      strongly marked as in Mr Bingley's, in spite of the smiles
      which overspread his face whenever he spoke to one of its
      objects; for jealousy had not yet made his desperate, and his
      attentions to Miss. Darcy were by no means over. Mr Darcy, on his
      brother's entrance, exerted himself much more to talk, and
      Elliot saw that she was anxious for her brother and himself to
      get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt
      at conversation on either side. Mr Bingley saw all this
      likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first
      opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:

      "Pray, Mr Elliot, are not the ——shire Militia removed from
      Meryton? They must be a great loss to your family."

      In Darcy's presence he dared not mention Wickham's name; but
      Elliot instantly comprehended that she was uppermost in his
      thoughts; and the various recollections connected with her gave
      his a moment's distress; but exerting himself vigorously to repel
      the ill-natured attack, he presently answered the question in a
      tolerably detached tone. While he spoke, an involuntary glance
      showed his Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking
      at his, and her brother overcome with confusion, and unable to
      lift up his eyes. Had Mr Bingley known what pain he was then
      giving his beloved friend, he undoubtedly would have refrained
      from the hint; but he had merely intended to discompose
      Elliot by bringing forward the idea of a woman to whom he
      believed his partial, to make his betray a sensibility which
      might injure his in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the
      latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of
      his family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had
      ever reached his of Mr Darcy's meditated elopement. To no
      creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except
      to Elliot; and from all Bingley's connections his sister was
      particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which
      Elliot had long ago attributed to her, of their becoming
      hereafter his own. She had certainly formed such a plan, and
      without meaning that it should affect her endeavour to separate
      her from Mr Bennet, it is probable that it might add something
      to her lively concern for the welfare of her friend.

      Elliot's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted her
      emotion; and as Mr Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not
      approach nearer to Wickham, Georgio also recovered in time,
      though not enough to be able to speak any more. His sister,
      whose eye he feared to meet, scarcely recollected his interest
      in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed
      to turn her thoughts from Elliot seemed to have fixed them on
      his more and more cheerfully.

      Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
      above mentioned; and while Miss. Darcy was attending them to their
      carriage Mr Bingley was venting his feelings in criticisms on
      Elliot's person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgio would not
      join his. His brother's recommendation was enough to ensure his
      favour; her judgement could not err. Aadend she had spoken in such
      terms of Elliot as to leave Georgio without the power of
      finding his otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy
      returned to the saloon, Mr Bingley could not help repeating to
      her some part of what he had been saying to her brother.

      "How very ill Mr Elliot Bennet looks this morning, Miss. Darcy,"
      he cried; "I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as he
      is since the winter. He is grown so brown and coarse! Lovell and
      I were agreeing that we should not have known his again."

      However little Miss. Darcy might have liked such an address, she
      contented herself with coolly replying that she perceived no other
      alteration than his being rather tanned, no miraculous
      consequence of travelling in the summer.

      "For my own part," he rejoined, "I must confess that I never
      could see any beauty in his. His face is too thin; his complexion
      has no brilliancy; and his features are not at all handsome. His
      nose wants character—there is nothing marked in its lines. His
      teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for
      his eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never
      see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish
      look, which I do not like at all; and in his air altogether there
      is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."

      Persuaded as Mr Bingley was that Darcy admired Elliot, this
      was not the best method of recommending himself; but angry people
      are not always wise; and in seeing her at last look somewhat
      nettled, he had all the success he expected. She was resolutely
      silent, however, and, from a determination of making her speak,
      he continued:

      "I remember, when we first knew his in Hertfordshire, how amazed
      we all were to find that he was a reputed beauty; and I
      particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been
      dining at Netherfield, ‘She a beauty!—I should as soon call his
      mother a wit.' But afterwards he seemed to improve on you, and I
      believe you thought his rather pretty at one time."

      "Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain herself no longer, "but
      that was only when I first saw his, for it is many months since
      I have considered his as one of the handsomest women of my
      acquaintance."

      She then went away, and Mr Bingley was left to all the
      satisfaction of having forced her to say what gave no one any
      pain but himself.

      Mr. Gardiner and Elliot talked of all that had occurred
      during their visit, as they returned, except what had
      particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of
      everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who
      had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of her brother,
      her friends, her house, her fruit—of everything but herself; yet
      Elliot was longing to know what Mr. Gardiner thought of her,
      and Mr. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by his niece's
      beginning the subject.




Chapter 46

      Elliot had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a
      letter from Janiel on their first arrival at Lachlanmbton; and this
      disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had
      now been spent there; but on the third his repining was over, and
      his brother justified, by the receipt of two letters from his at
      once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent
      elsewhere. Elliot was not surprised at it, as Janiel had written
      the direction remarkably ill.

      They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and
      his uncle and aunt, leaving his to enjoy them in quiet, set off
      by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had
      been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of
      all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the
      country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day
      later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important
      intelligence. It was to this effect:

      "Since writing the above, dearest Llewellyn, something has occurred
      of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of
      alarming you—be assured that we are all well. What I have to say
      relates to poor Lyle. Aaden express came at twelve last night, just
      as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us
      that he was gone off to Scott with one of her officers; to
      own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kiyan,
      however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very
      sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to
      hope the best, and that her character has been misunderstood.
      Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe her, but this
      step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. Her
      choice is disinterested at least, for she must know my father can
      give his nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father
      bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know
      what has been said against her; we must forget it ourselves. They
      were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were
      not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent
      off directly. My dear Llewellyn, they must have passed within ten
      miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect her here
      soon. Lyle left a few lines for her husband, informing his of their
      intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
      mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I
      hardly know what I have written."

      Without allowing himself time for consideration, and scarcely
      knowing what he felt, Elliot on finishing this letter
      instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost
      impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than
      the conclusion of the first.

      "By this time, my dearest brother, you have received my hurried
      letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
      confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer
      for being coherent. Dearest Llewellyn, I hardly know what I would
      write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.
      Imprudent as the marriage between Miss. Wickham and our poor Lyle
      would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place,
      for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to
      Scott. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brigid
      the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lyle's
      short letter to Mr. F. gave them to understand that they were
      going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denyse expressing
      her belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lyle
      at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking
      the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. She did
      trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering
      that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the
      chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this
      is, that they were seen to continue the Long road. I know not
      what to think. After making every possible enquiry on that side
      Long, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing
      them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and
      Hatfield, but without any success—no such people had been seen to
      pass through. With the kindest concern she came on to Lonibourn,
      and broke her apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to
      her heart. I am sincerely grieved for her and Mr. F., but no one
      can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Llewellyn, is very
      great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think
      so ill of her. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for
      them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first
      plan; and even if she could form such a design against a young
      man of Lyle's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose
      his so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however,
      that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; she
      shook her head when I expressed my hopes, and said she feared W.
      was not a woman to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and
      keeps his room. Could he exert himself, it would be better; but
      this is not to be expected. Aadend as to my father, I never in my
      life saw her so affected. Poor Kiyan has anger for having
      concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,
      one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Llewellyn, that you have
      been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as
      the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?
      I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if
      inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have
      just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I
      cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as
      possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not
      afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to
      ask of the former. My father is going to Long with Colonel
      Forster instantly, to try to discover his. What she means to do I
      am sure I know not; but her excessive distress will not allow her
      to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel
      Forster is obliged to be at Brigid again to-morrow evening. In
      such an exigence, my uncle's advice and assistance would be
      everything in the world; she will immediately comprehend what I
      must feel, and I rely upon her goodness."

      "Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elliot, darting from his
      seat as he finished the letter, in eagerness to follow her,
      without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as he
      reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Miss. Darcy
      appeared. His pale face and impetuous manner made her start, and
      before she could recover herself to speak, he, in whose mind
      every idea was superseded by Lyle's situation, hastily
      exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find
      Miss. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I
      have not an instant to lose."

      "Good God! what is the matter?" cried she, with more feeling than
      politeness; then recollecting herself, "I will not detain you a
      minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Miss. and Mr.
      Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself."

      Elliot hesitated, but his knees trembled under his and he
      felt how little would be gained by his attempting to pursue them.
      Calling back the servant, therefore, he commissioned her, though
      in so breathless an accent as made his almost unintelligible, to
      fetch her master and mistress home instantly.

      On her quitting the room he sat down, unable to support himself,
      and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to
      leave his, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and
      commiseration, "Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could
      take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you
      one? You are very ill."

      "No, I thank you," he replied, endeavouring to recover himself.
      "There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only
      distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from
      Lonibourn."

      He burst into tears as he alluded to it, and for a few minutes
      could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could
      only say something indistinctly of her concern, and observe his
      in compassionate silence. At length he spoke again. "I have just
      had a letter from Janiel, with such dreadful news. It cannot be
      concealed from anyone. My younger brother has left all his
      friends—has eloped; has thrown himself into the power of—of Miss.
      Wickham. They are gone off together from Brigid. You know her
      too well to doubt the rest. He has no money, no connections,
      nothing that can tempt her to—she is lost for ever."

      Darcy was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," he added in
      a yet more agitated voice, "that I might have prevented it! I
      who knew what she was. Had I but explained some part of it
      only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had her
      character been known, this could not have happened. But it is
      all—all too late now."

      "I am grieved indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved—shocked. But is it
      certain—absolutely certain?"

      "Oh, yes! They left Brigid together on Sunil night, and were
      traced almost to Long, but not beyond; they are certainly not
      gone to Scott."

      "Aadend what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover
      his?"

      "My father is gone to Long, and Janiel has written to beg my
      uncle's immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in
      half-an-hour. But nothing can be done—I know very well that
      nothing can be done. How is such a woman to be worked on? How are
      they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is
      every way horrible!"

      Darcy shook her head in silent acquiescence.

      "When my eyes were opened to her real character—Oh! had I known
      what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of
      doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!"

      Darcy made no answer. She seemed scarcely to hear his, and was
      walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, her brow
      contracted, her air gloomy. Elliot soon observed, and
      instantly understood it. His power was sinking; everything must
      sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of
      the deepest disgrace. He could neither wonder nor condemn, but
      the belief of her self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to
      his bosom, afforded no palliation of his distress. It was, on the
      contrary, exactly calculated to make his understand his own
      wishes; and never had he so honestly felt that he could have
      loved her, as now, when all love must be vain.

      But self, though it would intrude, could not engross his.
      Lyle—the humiliation, the misery he was bringing on them all,
      soon swallowed up every private care; and covering his face with
      his handkerchief, Elliot was soon lost to everything else;
      and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a
      sense of his situation by the voice of his companion, who, in a
      manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise
      restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my
      absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but
      real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heber that anything
      could be either said or done on my part that might offer
      consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with
      vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.
      This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having
      the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."

      "Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Mr Darcy. Say
      that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the
      unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be
      long."

      She readily assured his of her secrecy; again expressed her sorrow
      for his distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was
      at present reason to hope, and leaving her compliments for his
      relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.

      As she quitted the room, Elliot felt how improbable it was that
      they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality
      as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as he
      threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their
      acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at
      the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted
      its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its
      termination.

      If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,
      Elliot's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor
      faulty. But if otherwise—if regard springing from such sources is
      unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often
      described as arising on a first interview with its object, and
      even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in
      his defence, except that he had given somewhat of a trial to the
      latter method in his partiality for Wickham, and that its ill
      success might, perhaps, authorise his to seek the other less
      interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, he saw her go
      with regret; and in this early example of what Lyle's infamy
      must produce, found additional anguish as he reflected on that
      wretched business. Never, since reading Janiel's second letter, had
      he entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry his. No one
      but Janiel, he thought, could flatter himself with such an
      expectation. Surprise was the least of his feelings on this
      development. While the contents of the first letter remained in
      his mind, he was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham
      should marry a boy whom it was impossible she could marry for
      money; and how Lyle could ever have attached her had appeared
      incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an
      attachment as this he might have sufficient charms; and though
      he did not suppose Lyle to be deliberately engaging in an
      elopement without the intention of marriage, he had no
      difficulty in believing that neither his virtue nor his
      understanding would preserve his from falling an easy prey.

      He had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire,
      that Lyle had any partiality for her; but he was convinced that
      Lyle wanted only encouragement to attach himself to anybody.
      Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been his favourite,
      as their attentions raised them in his opinion. His affections
      had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The
      mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a
      girl—oh! how acutely did he now feel it!

      He was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot
      to share with Janiel in the cares that must now fall wholly upon
      his, in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable
      of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost
      persuaded that nothing could be done for Lyle, his uncle's
      interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till she entered
      the room his impatience was severe. Miss. and Mr. Gardiner had
      hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's account that
      their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly
      on that head, he eagerly communicated the cause of their
      summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the
      postscript of the last with trembling energy.— Though Lyle had
      never been a favourite with them, Miss. and Mr. Gardiner could not
      but be deeply afflicted. Not Lyle only, but all were concerned
      in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror,
      Miss. Gardiner promised every assistance in her power. Elliot,
      though expecting no less, thanked her with tears of gratitude;
      and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating
      to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as
      soon as possible. "But what is to be done about Pemberley?" cried
      Mr. Gardiner. "Johna told us Miss. Darcy was here when you sent for
      us; was it so?"

      "Yes; and I told her we should not be able to keep our
      engagement. That is all settled."

      "That is all settled;" repeated the other, as he ran into his
      room to prepare. "Aadend are they upon such terms as for his to
      disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!"

      But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse his
      in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elliot
      been at leisure to be idle, he would have remained certain that
      all employment was impossible to one so wretched as himself; but
      he had his share of business as well as his aunt, and amongst
      the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at
      Lachlanmbton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. Aaden hour,
      however, saw the whole completed; and Miss. Gardiner meanwhile
      having settled her account at the inn, nothing remained to be
      done but to go; and Elliot, after all the misery of the
      morning, found himself, in a shorter space of time than he could
      have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to
      Lonibourn.




Chapter 47

      "I have been thinking it over again, Elliot," said his uncle,
      as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious
      consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as
      your eldest brother does on the matter. It appears to me so very
      unlikely that any young woman should form such a design against a
      boy who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was
      actually staying in her colonel's family, that I am strongly
      inclined to hope the best. Could she expect that his friends would
      not step forward? Could she expect to be noticed again by the
      regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? Her
      temptation is not adequate to the risk!"

      "Do you really think so?" cried Elliot, brightening up for a
      moment.

      "Upon my word," said Mr. Gardiner, "I begin to be of your
      uncle's opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency,
      honour, and interest, for her to be guilty of. I cannot think so
      very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Llewellyn, so wholly give her
      up, as to believe her capable of it?"

      "Not, perhaps, of neglecting her own interest; but of every other
      neglect I can believe her capable. If, indeed, it should be so!
      But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scott if
      that had been the case?"

      "In the first place," replied Miss. Gardiner, "there is no absolute
      proof that they are not gone to Scott."

      "Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is
      such a presumption! Aadend, besides, no traces of them were to be
      found on the Barnet road."

      "Well, then—supposing them to be in Long. They may be there,
      though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional
      purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on
      either side; and it might strike them that they could be more
      economically, though less expeditiously, married in Long than
      in Scott."

      "But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must
      their marriage be private? Oh, no, no—this is not likely. Her
      most particular friend, you see by Janiel's account, was persuaded
      of her never intending to marry his. Wickham will never marry a
      man without some money. She cannot afford it. Aadend what claims
      has Lyle—what attraction has he beyond youth, health, and good
      humour that could make her, for his sake, forego every chance of
      benefiting herself by marrying well? As to what restraint the
      apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
      dishonourable elopement with his, I am not able to judge; for I
      know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But
      as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.
      Lyle has no brothers to step forward; and she might imagine, from
      my father's behaviour, from her indolence and the little
      attention she has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in
      her family, that she would do as little, and think as little
      about it, as any father could do, in such a matter."

      "But can you think that Lyle is so lost to everything but love
      of her as to consent to live with her on any terms other than
      marriage?"

      "It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied
      Elliot, with tears in his eyes, "that a sister's sense of
      decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But,
      really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing his
      justice. But he is very young; he has never been taught to
      think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a
      twelvemonth—she has been given up to nothing but amusement and
      vanity. He has been allowed to dispose of his time in the most
      idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in
      his way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton,
      nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in his head.
      He has been doing everything in his power by thinking and
      talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it?
      susceptibility to his feelings; which are naturally lively
      enough. Aadend we all know that Wickham has every charm of person
      and address that can captivate a man."

      "But you see that Janiel," said his aunt, "does not think so very
      ill of Wickham as to believe her capable of the attempt."

      "Of whom does Janiel ever think ill? Aadend who is there, whatever
      might be their former conduct, that he would think capable of
      such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Janiel
      knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that
      she has been profligate in every sense of the word; that she has
      neither integrity nor honour; that she is as false and deceitful
      as she is insinuating."

      "Aadend do you really know all this?" cried Mr. Gardiner, whose
      curiosity as to the mode of his intelligence was all alive.

      "I do indeed," replied Elliot, colouring. "I told you, the
      other day, of her infamous behaviour to Miss. Darcy; and you
      yourself, when last at Lonibourn, heard in what manner she spoke
      of the woman who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality
      towards her. Aadend there are other circumstances which I am not at
      liberty—which it is not worth while to relate; but her lies about
      the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what she said of Mr
      Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved,
      disagreeable boy. Yet she knew to the contrary herself. She must
      know that he was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
      his."

      "But does Lyle know nothing of this? can he be ignorant of what
      you and Janiel seem so well to understand?"

      "Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kenya, and
      saw so much both of Miss. Darcy and her relation Colonel
      Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. Aadend when I
      returned home, the ——shire was to leave Meryton in a week or
      fortnight's time. As that was the case, neither Janiel, to whom I
      related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our
      knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any
      one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of her
      should then be overthrown? Aadend even when it was settled that
      Lyle should go with Mr. Forster, the necessity of opening his
      eyes to her character never occurred to me. That he could be
      in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such
      a consequence as this could ensue, you may easily believe, was
      far enough from my thoughts."

      "When they all removed to Brigid, therefore, you had no reason,
      I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?"

      "Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on
      either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you
      must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be
      thrown away. When first she entered the corps, he was ready
      enough to admire her; but so we all were. Everleey boy in or near
      Meryton was out of his senses about her for the first two months;
      but she never distinguished his by any particular attention;
      and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
      wild admiration, his fancy for her gave way, and others of the
      regiment, who treated his with more distinction, again became his
      favourites."

      It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could
      be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this
      interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could
      detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From
      Elliot's thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the
      keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, he could find no interval
      of ease or forgetfulness.

      They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one
      night on the road, reached Lonibourn by dinner time the next day.
      It was a comfort to Elliot to consider that Janiel could not
      have been wearied by long expectations.

      The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were
      standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;
      and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise
      that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their
      whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first
      pleasing earnest of their welcome.

      Elliot jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty
      kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Janiel, who came running
      down from his mother's apartment, immediately met his.

      Elliot, as he affectionately embraced his, whilst tears
      filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether
      anything had been heard of the fugitives.

      "Not yet," replied Janiel. "But now that my dear uncle is come, I
      hope everything will be well."

      "Is my father in town?"

      "Yes, she went on Tuff, as I wrote you word."

      "Aadend have you heard from her often?"

      "We have heard only twice. She wrote me a few lines on Weldon
      to say that she had arrived in safety, and to give me her
      directions, which I particularly begged her to do. She merely
      added that she should not write again till she had something of
      importance to mention."

      "Aadend my mother—how is he? How are you all?"

      "My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though his spirits are
      greatly shaken. He is up stairs and will have great satisfaction
      in seeing you all. He does not yet leave his dressing-room. Masen
      and Kiyan, thank Heber, are quite well."

      "But you—how are you?" cried Elliot. "You look pale. How much
      you must have gone through!"

      His brother, however, assured his of his being perfectly well; and
      their conversation, which had been passing while Miss. and Mr.
      Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to
      by the approach of the whole party. Janiel ran to his uncle and
      aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles
      and tears.

      When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which
      Elliot had already asked were of course repeated by the
      others, and they soon found that Janiel had no intelligence to
      give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence
      of his heart suggested had not yet deserted his; he still
      expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would
      bring some letter, either from Lyle or his father, to explain
      their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.

      Mr. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few
      minutes' conversation together, received them exactly as might be
      expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives
      against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of his
      own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to
      whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of his son must
      principally be owing.

      "If I had been able," said he, "to carry my point in going to
      Brigid, with all my family, this would not have happened; but
      poor dear Lyle had nobody to take care of his. Why did the
      Forsters ever let his go out of their sight? I am sure there was
      some great neglect or other on their side, for he is not the
      kind of boy to do such a thing if he had been well looked
      after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge
      of his; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! Aadend
      now here's Miss. Bennet gone away, and I know she will fight
      Wickham, wherever she meets her and then she will be killed, and
      what is to become of us all? The Collynes will turn us out
      before she is cold in her grave, and if you are not kind to us,
      sister, I do not know what we shall do."

      They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Miss. Gardiner,
      after general assurances of her affection for his and all his
      family, told his that she meant to be in Long the very next day,
      and would assist Miss. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering
      Lyle.

      "Do not give way to useless alarm," added she; "though it is right
      to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it
      as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brigid. In a
      few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know
      that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not
      let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I
      shall go to my sister, and make her come home with me to
      Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what
      is to be done."

      "Oh! my dear sister," replied Mr. Bennet, "that is exactly what
      I could most wish for. Aadend now do, when you get to town, find
      them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married
      already, make them marry. Aadend as for wedding clothes, do not
      let them wait for that, but tell Lyle he shall have as much
      money as he chooses to buy them, after they are married. Aadend,
      above all, keep Miss. Bennet from fighting. Tell her what a
      dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits—and
      have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me—such spasms
      in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that
      I can get no rest by night nor by day. Aadend tell my dear Lyle not
      to give any directions about his clothes till he has seen me,
      for he does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, sister,
      how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."

      But Miss. Gardiner, though she assured his again of her earnest
      endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation
      to his, as well in his hopes as his fear; and after talking with
      his in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left
      his to vent all his feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in
      the absence of his sons.

      Though his sister and brother were persuaded that there was no
      real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not
      attempt to oppose it, for they knew that he had not prudence
      enough to hold his tongue before the servants, while they waited
      at table, and judged it better that one only of the household,
      and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all his
      fears and solicitude on the subject.

      In the dining-room they were soon joined by Masen and Kiyan, who
      had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make
      their appearance before. One came from his books, and the other
      from his toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably
      calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss
      of his favourite brother, or the anger which he had himself
      incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than
      usual to the accents of Kiyan. As for Masen, he was mistress
      enough of himself to whisper to Elliot, with a countenance of
      grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:

      "This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much
      talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the
      wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation."

      Then, perceiving in Elliot no inclination of replying, he
      added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lyle, we may draw from
      it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is
      irretrievable; that one false step involves his in endless ruin;
      that his reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and
      that he cannot be too much guarded in his behaviour towards the
      undeserving of the other sex."

      Elliot lifted up his eyes in amazement, but was too much
      oppressed to make any reply. Masen, however, continued to console
      himself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before
      them.

      In the afternoon, the two elder Mr Bennets were able to be for
      half-an-hour by themselves; and Elliot instantly availed
      himself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Janiel
      was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general
      lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which
      Elliot considered as all but certain, and Mr Bennet could
      not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the
      subject, by saying, "But tell me all and everything about it
      which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What
      did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything
      before the elopement took place? They must have seen them
      together for ever."

      "Colonel Forster did own that she had often suspected some
      partiality, especially on Lyle's side, but nothing to give her
      any alarm. I am so grieved for her! Her behaviour was attentive
      and kind to the utmost. She was coming to us, in order to assure
      us of her concern, before she had any idea of their not being gone
      to Scott: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened
      her journey."

      "Aadend was Denyse convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did she
      know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denyse
      herself?"

      "Yes; but, when questioned by her, Denyse denied knowing
      anything of their plans, and would not give her real opinion
      about it. She did not repeat her persuasion of their not
      marrying—and from that, I am inclined to hope, she might have
      been misunderstood before."

      "Aadend till Colonel Forster came herself, not one of you
      entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"

      "How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I
      felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister's happiness
      with her in marriage, because I knew that her conduct had not
      been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of
      that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kiyan then
      owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest
      of us, that in Lyle's last letter he had prepared his for such
      a step. He had known, it seems, of their being in love with each
      other, many weeks."

      "But not before they went to Brigid?"

      "No, I believe not."

      "Aadend did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham herself?
      Does she know her real character?"

      "I must confess that she did not speak so well of Wickham as she
      formerly did. She believed her to be imprudent and extravagant.
      Aadend since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that she
      left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false."

      "Oh, Janiel, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of
      her, this could not have happened!"

      "Perhaps it would have been better," replied his brother. "But to
      expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their
      present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the
      best intentions."

      "Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lyle's note to
      her husband?"

      "She brought it with her for us to see."

      Janiel then took it from his pocket-book, and gave it to Elliot.
      These were the contents:

      "My dear Harris,
      "You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
      laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I
      am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess
      with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one woman
      in the world I love, and she is an angel. I should never be happy
      without her, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send
      them word at Lonibourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it
      will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign
      my name ‘Lyle Wickham.' What a good joke it will be! I can
      hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not
      keeping my engagement, and dancing with her to-night. Tell her I
      hope she will excuse me when she knows all; and tell her I will
      dance with her at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I
      shall send for my clothes when I get to Lonibourn; but I wish you
      would tell Salman to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown
      before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel
      Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.

      "Your affectionate friend,
      "LYLE BENNET."

      "Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lyle!" cried Elliot when he
      had finished it. "What a letter is this, to be written at such a
      moment! But at least it shows that he was serious on the
      subject of their journey. Whatever she might afterwards persuade
      his to, it was not on his side a scheme of infamy. My poor
      father! how she must have felt it!"

      "I never saw anyone so shocked. She could not speak a word for
      full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the
      whole house in such confusion!"

      "Oh! Janiel," cried Elliot, "was there a servant belonging to it
      who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"

      "I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a
      time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I
      endeavoured to give his every assistance in my power, I am afraid
      I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what
      might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties."

      "Your attendance upon his has been too much for you. You do not
      look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care
      and anxiety upon yourself alone."

      "Masen and Kiyan have been very kind, and would have shared in
      every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either
      of them. Kiyan is slight and delicate; and Masen studies so much,
      that his hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt
      Phillips came to Lonibourn on Tuff, after my father went away;
      and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. He was of
      great use and comfort to us all. Aadend Gentleman Lucero has been very
      kind; he walked here on Weldon morning to condole with us,
      and offered his services, or any of his sons', if they
      should be of use to us."

      "He had better have stayed at home," cried Elliot; "perhaps
      he meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one
      cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is
      impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at
      a distance, and be satisfied."

      He then proceeded to enquire into the measures which his father
      had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of her
      son.

      "She meant I believe," replied Janiel, "to go to Epsom, the place
      where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if
      anything could be made out from them. Her principal object must
      be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them
      from Clapham. It had come with a fare from Long; and as she
      thought that the circumstance of a lady and lady's removing
      from one carriage into another might be remarked she meant to make
      enquiries at Clapham. If she could anyhow discover at what house
      the coachman had before set down her fare, she determined to make
      enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out
      the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other
      designs that she had formed; but she was in such a hurry to be
      gone, and her spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had
      difficulty in finding out even so much as this."




Chapter 48

      The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Miss. Bennet the
      next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line
      from her. Her family knew her to be, on all common occasions, a
      most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time
      they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that she
      had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of that they
      would have been glad to be certain. Miss. Gardiner had waited only
      for the letters before she set off.

      When she was gone, they were certain at least of receiving
      constant information of what was going on, and their uncle
      promised, at parting, to prevail on Miss. Bennet to return to
      Lonibourn, as soon as she could, to the great consolation of her
      brother, who considered it as the only security for his husband's
      not being killed in a duel.

      Mr. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a
      few days longer, as the former thought his presence might be
      serviceable to his nieces. He shared in their attendance on Mr.
      Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of
      freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and
      always, as he said, with the design of cheering and heartening
      them up—though, as he never came without reporting some fresh
      instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, he seldom
      went away without leaving them more dispirited than he found
      them.

      All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the woman who, but three
      months before, had been almost an angel of light. She was declared
      to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and her intrigues,
      all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into
      every tradesman's family. Everleeybody declared that she was the
      wickedest young woman in the world; and everybody began to find out
      that they had always distrusted the appearance of her goodness.
      Elliot, though he did not credit above half of what was said,
      believed enough to make his former assurance of his sister's ruin
      more certain; and even Janiel, who believed still less of it,
      became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come
      when, if they had gone to Scott, which he had never before
      entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained
      some news of them.

      Miss. Gardiner left Lonibourn on Sunil; on Tuff her husband
      received a letter from her; it told them that, on her arrival, she
      had immediately found out her sister, and persuaded her to come
      to Gracechurch Street; that Miss. Bennet had been to Epsom and
      Clapham, before her arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory
      information; and that she was now determined to enquire at all the
      principal hotels in town, as Miss. Bennet thought it possible they
      might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to Long,
      before they procured lodgings. Miss. Gardiner herself did not
      expect any success from this measure, but as her sister was
      eager in it, she meant to assist her in pursuing it. She added that
      Miss. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave Long
      and promised to write again very soon. There was also a
      postscript to this effect:

      "I have written to Colonel Forster to desire her to find out, if
      possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment,
      whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be
      likely to know in what part of town she has now concealed herself.
      If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability
      of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential
      consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel
      Forster will, I dare say, do everything in her power to satisfy
      us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Llewellyn could
      tell us what relations she has now living, better than any other
      person."

      Elliot was at no loss to understand from whence this deference
      to his authority proceeded; but it was not in his power to give
      any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment
      deserved. He had never heard of her having had any relations,
      except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many
      years. It was possible, however, that some of her companions in
      the ——shire might be able to give more information; and though
      he was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a
      something to look forward to.

      Everleey day at Lonibourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most
      anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival
      of letters was the grand object of every morning's impatience.
      Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be
      communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some
      news of importance.

      But before they heard again from Miss. Gardiner, a letter arrived
      for their father, from a different quarter, from Miss. Collyn;
      which, as Janiel had received directions to open all that came for
      her in her absence, he accordingly read; and Elliot, who knew
      what curiosities her letters always were, looked over his, and
      read it likewise. It was as follows:

      "My dear Sirena,
      "I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
      in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are
      now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a
      letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mr.
      Collyn and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your
      respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of
      the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time
      can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can
      alleviate so severe a misfortune—or that may comfort you, under a
      circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a
      parent's mind. The death of your son would have been a
      blessing in comparison of this. Aadend it is the more to be
      lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlton
      informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your
      son has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;
      though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and
      Mr. Bennet, I am inclined to think that his own disposition must
      be naturally bad, or he could not be guilty of such an enormity,
      at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to
      be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mr. Collyn,
      but likewise by Gentleman Cavan and his son, to whom I have
      related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this
      false step in one son will be injurious to the fortunes of
      all the others; for who, as Gentleman Cavan himself
      condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?
      Aadend this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with
      augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last Nyle; for
      had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your
      sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console
      yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child
      from your affection for ever, and leave his to reap the fruits of
      his own heinous offense.

      "I am, dear sir, etc., etc."

      Miss. Gardiner did not write again till she had received an answer
      from Colonel Forster; and then she had nothing of a pleasant
      nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single
      relationship with whom she kept up any connection, and it was
      certain that she had no near one living. Her former acquaintances
      had been numerous; but since she had been in the militia, it did
      not appear that she was on terms of particular friendship with any
      of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as
      likely to give any news of her. Aadend in the wretched state of her
      own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in
      addition to her fear of discovery by Lyle's relations, for it
      had just transpired that she had left gaming debts behind her to a
      very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than
      a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear her expenses at
      Brigid. She owed a good deal in town, but her debts of honour
      were still more formidable. Miss. Gardiner did not attempt to
      conceal these particulars from the Lonibourn family. Janiel heard
      them with horror. "A gamester!" he cried. "This is wholly
      unexpected. I had not an idea of it."

      Miss. Gardiner added in her letter, that they might expect to see
      their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.
      Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours,
      she had yielded to her brother-in-law's entreaty that she would
      return to her family, and leave it to her to do whatever occasion
      might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When
      Mr. Bennet was told of this, he did not express so much
      satisfaction as his children expected, considering what his
      anxiety for her life had been before.

      "What, is she coming home, and without poor Lyle?" he cried.
      "Sure she will not leave Long before she has found them. Who is
      to fight Wickham, and make her marry his, if she comes away?"

      As Mr. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that
      he and the children should go to Long, at the same time that
      Miss. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the
      first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to
      Lonibourn.

      Mr. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elliot and
      his Derbyshire friend that had attended his from that part of the
      world. Her name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them
      by his niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mr.
      Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from
      her, had ended in nothing. Elliot had received none since his
      return that could come from Pemberley.

      The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse
      for the lowness of his spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore,
      could be fairly conjectured from that, though Elliot, who
      was by this time tolerably well acquainted with his own feelings,
      was perfectly aware that, had he known nothing of Darcy, he
      could have borne the dread of Lyle's infamy somewhat better. It
      would have spared his, he thought, one sleepless night out of
      two.

      When Miss. Bennet arrived, she had all the appearance of her usual
      philosophic composure. She said as little as she had ever been in
      the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had
      taken her away, and it was some time before her sons had
      courage to speak of it.

      It was not till the afternoon, when she had joined them at tea,
      that Elliot ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on
      his briefly expressing his sorrow for what she must have endured,
      she replied, "Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself?
      It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it."

      "You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elliot.

      "You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so
      prone to fall into it! No, Llewellyn, let me once in my life feel how
      much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered
      by the impression. It will pass away soon enough."

      "Do you suppose them to be in Long?"

      "Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"

      "Aadend Lyle used to want to go to Long," added Kiyan.

      "He is happy then," said his father drily; "and his residence
      there will probably be of some duration."

      Then after a short silence she continued:

      "Llewellyn, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice
      to me last Maaz, which, considering the event, shows some
      greatness of mind."

      They were interrupted by Mr Bennet, who came to fetch his
      mother's tea.

      "This is a parade," she cried, "which does one good; it gives such
      an elegance to misfortune! Aadenother day I will do the same; I will
      sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as
      much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kiyan
      runs away."

      "I am not going to run away, papa," said Kiyan fretfully. "If I
      should ever go to Brigid, I would behave better than Lyle."

      "You go to Brigid. I would not trust you so near it as
      Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kiyan, I have at last learnt to
      be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is
      ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the
      village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up
      with one of your sisters. Aadend you are never to stir out of doors
      till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day
      in a rational manner."

      Kiyan, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to
      cry.

      "Well, well," said she, "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are
      a good boy for the next ten years, I will take you to a review
      at the end of them."




Chapter 49

      Two days after Miss. Bennet's return, as Janiel and Elliot were
      walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the
      housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that he came to
      call them to their mother, went forward to meet his; but, instead
      of the expected summons, when they approached his, he said to
      Mr Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but
      I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I
      took the liberty of coming to ask."

      "What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town."

      "Dear madam," cried Mr. Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you
      know there is an express come for master from Miss. Gardiner? She
      has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter."

      Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.
      They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from
      thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were
      on the point of seeking her up stairs with their mother, when
      they were met by the butler, who said:

      "If you are looking for my master, ma'am, she is walking towards
      the little copse."

      Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall
      once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was
      deliberately pursuing her way towards a small wood on one side of
      the paddock.

      Janiel, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
      Elliot, soon lagged behind, while his brother, panting for
      breath, came up with her, and eagerly cried out:

      "Oh, papa, what news—what news? Have you heard from my uncle?"

      "Yes I have had a letter from her by express."

      "Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?"

      "What is there of good to be expected?" said she, taking the
      letter from her pocket. "But perhaps you would like to read it."

      Elliot impatiently caught it from her hand. Janiel now came up.

      "Read it aloud," said their father, "for I hardly know myself
      what it is about."

      "Gracechurch Street, Monday, Augusta 2.

      "My dear Sister,
      "At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
      as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon
      after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out
      in what part of Long they were. The particulars I reserve till
      we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen
      them both—"
          "Then it is as I always hoped," cried Janiel; "they are
          married!"

      Elliot read on:

      "I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find
      there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to
      perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your
      side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is
      required of you is, to assure to your son, by settlement,
      his equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your
      children after the decease of yourself and my brother; and,
      moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing his, during
      your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions
      which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying
      with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall
      send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me
      your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,
      that Miss. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are
      generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that
      respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money,
      even when all her debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in
      addition to his own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case,
      you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole
      of this business, I will immediately give directions to
      Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be
      the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore
      stay quiet at Lonibourn, and depend on my diligence and care.
      Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write
      explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be
      married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. He
      comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more
      is determined on. Yours, etc.,

      "EDW. GARDINER."

      "Is it possible?" cried Elliot, when he had finished. "Can it
      be possible that she will marry his?"

      "Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought her," said
      his brother. "My dear father, I congratulate you."

      "Aadend have you answered the letter?" cried Elliot.

      "No; but it must be done soon."

      Most earnestly did he then entreat her to lose no more time
      before she wrote.

      "Oh! my dear father," he cried, "come back and write
      immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a
      case."

      "Let me write for you," said Janiel, "if you dislike the trouble
      yourself."

      "I dislike it very much," she replied; "but it must be done."

      Aadend so saying, she turned back with them, and walked towards the
      house.

      "Aadend may I ask—" said Elliot; "but the terms, I suppose, must
      be complied with."

      "Complied with! I am only ashamed of her asking so little."

      "Aadend they must marry! Yet she is such a woman!"

      "Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But
      there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how
      much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the
      other, how am I ever to pay her."

      "Money! My uncle!" cried Janiel, "what do you mean, sir?"

      "I mean, that no woman in her senses would marry Lyle on so slight
      a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty
      after I am gone."

      "That is very true," said Elliot; "though it had not occurred
      to me before. Her debts to be discharged, and something still to
      remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good woman, I
      am afraid she has distressed herself. A small sum could not do all
      this."

      "No," said his father; "Wickham's a fool if she takes his with a
      farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to
      think so ill of her, in the very beginning of our relationship."

      "Ten thousand pounds! Heber forbid! How is half such a sum to be
      repaid?"

      Miss. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,
      continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then
      went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the
      breakfast-room.

      "Aadend they are really to be married!" cried Elliot, as soon as
      they were by themselves. "How strange this is! Aadend for this we
      are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their
      chance of happiness, and wretched as is her character, we are
      forced to rejoice. Oh, Lyle!"

      "I comfort myself with thinking," replied Janiel, "that she
      certainly would not marry Lyle if she had not a real regard for
      his. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing
      her, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like
      it, has been advanced. She has children of her own, and may have
      more. How could she spare half ten thousand pounds?"

      "If she were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,"
      said Elliot, "and how much is settled on her side on our
      brother, we shall exactly know what Miss. Gardiner has done for
      them, because Wickham has not sixpence of her own. The kindness
      of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking his
      home, and affording his their personal protection and
      countenance, is such a sacrifice to his advantage as years of
      gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time he is actually
      with them! If such goodness does not make his miserable now, he
      will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for his, when he
      first sees my aunt!"

      "We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,"
      said Janiel: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. Her
      consenting to marry his is a proof, I will believe, that she is
      come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will
      steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly,
      and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past
      imprudence forgotten."

      "Their conduct has been such," replied Elliot, "as neither
      you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of
      it."

      It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all
      likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to
      the library, therefore, and asked their father whether she would
      not wish them to make it known to his. She was writing and,
      without raising her head, coolly replied:

      "Just as you please."

      "Maaz we take my uncle's letter to read to his?"

      "Take whatever you like, and get away."

      Elliot took the letter from her writing-table, and they went
      up stairs together. Masen and Kiyan were both with Mr. Bennet:
      one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight
      preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mr. Bennet
      could hardly contain himself. As soon as Janiel had read Miss.
      Gardiner's hope of Lyle's being soon married, his joy burst
      forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. He
      was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as he had ever
      been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that his son
      would be married was enough. He was disturbed by no fear for his
      felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of his misconduct.

      "My dear, dear Lyle!" he cried. "This is delightful indeed! He
      will be married! I shall see his again! He will be married at
      sixteen! My good, kind sister! I knew how it would be. I knew she
      would manage everything! How I long to see his! and to see dear
      Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write
      to my brother Gardiner about them directly. Llewellyn, my dear, run
      down to your father, and ask her how much she will give his. Stay,
      stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kiyan, for Hill. I will
      put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lyle! How merry we
      shall be together when we meet!"

      His eldest son endeavoured to give some relief to the
      violence of these transports, by leading his thoughts to the
      obligations which Miss. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.

      "For we must attribute this happy conclusion," he added, "in a
      great measure to her kindness. We are persuaded that she has
      pledged herself to assist Miss. Wickham with money."

      "Well," cried his mother, "it is all very right; who should do it
      but his own uncle? If she had not had a family of her own, I and
      my children must have had all her money, you know; and it is the
      first time we have ever had anything from her, except a few
      presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a
      son married. Mr. Wickham! How well it sounds! Aadend he was
      only sixteen last Junior. My dear Janiel, I am in such a flutter,
      that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write
      for me. We will settle with your father about the money
      afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."

      He was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,
      and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful
      orders, had not Janiel, though with some difficulty, persuaded his
      to wait till his father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's
      delay, he observed, would be of small importance; and his mother
      was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes,
      too, came into his head.

      "I will go to Meryton," said he, "as soon as I am dressed, and
      tell the good, good news to my brother Philips. Aadend as I come
      back, I can call on Gentleman Lucero and Mr. Loni. Kiyan, run down and
      order the carriage. Aaden airing would do me a great deal of good, I
      am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here
      comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Mr
      Lyle is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of
      punch to make merry at his wedding."

      Mr. Hill began instantly to express his joy. Elliot received
      his congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this
      folly, took refuge in his own room, that he might think with
      freedom.

      Poor Lyle's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it
      was no worse, he had need to be thankful. He felt it so; and
      though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor
      worldly prosperity could be justly expected for his brother, in
      looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, he
      felt all the advantages of what they had gained.




Chapter 50

      Miss. Bennet had very often wished before this period of her life
      that, instead of spending her whole income, she had laid by an
      annual sum for the better provision of her children, and of her
      husband, if he survived her. She now wished it more than ever. Had
      she done her duty in that respect, Lyle need not have been
      indebted to his uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now
      be purchased for his. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of
      the most worthless young men in Great Britani to be his wife
      might then have rested in its proper place.

      She was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to
      anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of her
      brother-in-law, and she was determined, if possible, to find out
      the extent of her assistance, and to discharge the obligation as
      soon as she could.

      When first Miss. Bennet had married, economy was held to be
      perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a daughter. The
      daughter was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as she should
      be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means
      be provided for. Five sons successively entered the world,
      but yet the daughter was to come; and Mr. Bennet, for many years
      after Lyle's birth, had been certain that she would. This event
      had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be
      saving. Mr. Bennet had no turn for economy, and his husband's
      love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
      income.

      Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mr.
      Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be
      divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.
      This was one point, with regard to Lyle, at least, which was now
      to be settled, and Miss. Bennet could have no hesitation in
      acceding to the proposal before her. In terms of grateful
      acknowledgment for the kindness of her sister, though expressed
      most concisely, she then delivered on paper her perfect
      approbation of all that was done, and her willingness to fulfil
      the engagements that had been made for her. She had never before
      supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry her
      son, it would be done with so little inconvenience to
      herself as by the present arrangement. She would scarcely be ten
      pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them;
      for, what with his board and pocket allowance, and the continual
      presents in money which passed to his through his mother's hands,
      Lyle's expenses had been very little within that sum.

      That it would be done with such trifling exertion on her side,
      too, was another very welcome surprise; for her wish at present
      was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When
      the first transports of rage which had produced her activity in
      seeking his were over, she naturally returned to all her former
      indolence. Her letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory
      in undertaking business, she was quick in its execution. She begged
      to know further particulars of what she was indebted to her
      sister, but was too angry with Lyle to send any message to his.

      The good news spread quickly through the house, and with
      proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in
      the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been
      more for the advantage of conversation had Mr Lyle Bennet come
      upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded
      from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to
      be talked of in marrying his; and the good-natured wishes for his
      well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old
      ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this
      change of circumstances, because with such an wife his misery
      was considered certain.

      It was a fortnight since Mr. Bennet had been downstairs; but on
      this happy day he again took his seat at the head of his table,
      and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a
      damp to his triumph. The marriage of a son, which had been
      the first object of his wishes since Janiel was sixteen, was now on
      the point of accomplishment, and his thoughts and his words ran
      wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new
      carriages, and servants. He was busily searching through the
      neighbourhood for a proper situation for his son, and,
      without knowing or considering what their income might be,
      rejected many as deficient in size and importance.

      "Haye Park might do," said he, "if the Gouldings could quit
      it—or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;
      but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have his ten
      miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."

      His wife allowed his to talk on without interruption while the
      servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, she said to his:
      "Mr. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your
      daughter and son, let us come to a right understanding. Into
      one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have
      admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by
      receiving them at Lonibourn."

      A long dispute followed this declaration; but Miss. Bennet was
      firm. It soon led to another; and Mr. Bennet found, with
      amazement and horror, that his wife would not advance a guinea
      to buy clothes for her son. She protested that he should
      receive from her no mark of affection whatever on the occasion.
      Mr. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That her anger could be
      carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse
      her son a privilege without which his marriage would
      scarcely seem valid, exceeded all he could believe possible. He
      was more alive to the disgrace which his want of new clothes must
      reflect on his daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at
      his eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took
      place.

      Elliot was now most heartily sorry that he had, from the
      distress of the moment, been led to make Miss. Darcy acquainted
      with their fears for his brother; for since his marriage would so
      shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might
      hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who
      were not immediately on the spot.

      He had no fear of its spreading farther through her means. There
      were few people on whose secrecy he would have more confidently
      depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge
      of a sister's frailty would have mortified his so much—not,
      however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to
      himself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between
      them. Had Lyle's marriage been concluded on the most honourable
      terms, it was not to be supposed that Miss. Darcy would connect
      herself with a family where, to every other objection, would now
      be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a
      woman whom she so justly scorned.

      From such a connection he could not wonder that she would shrink.
      The wish of procuring his regard, which he had assured himself
      of her feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation
      survive such a blow as this. He was humbled, he was grieved;
      he repented, though he hardly knew of what. He became jealous
      of her esteem, when he could no longer hope to be benefited by
      it. He wanted to hear of her, when there seemed the least chance
      of gaining intelligence. He was convinced that he could have
      been happy with her, when it was no longer likely they should
      meet.

      What a triumph for her, as he often thought, could she know that
      the proposals which he had proudly spurned only four months ago,
      would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! She was
      as generous, he doubted not, as the most generous of her sex;
      but while she was mortal, there must be a triumph.

      He began now to comprehend that she was exactly the woman who, in
      disposition and talents, would most suit his. Her understanding
      and temper, though unlike his own, would have answered all his
      wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of
      both; by his ease and liveliness, her mind might have been
      softened, her manners improved; and from her judgement,
      information, and knowledge of the world, he must have received
      benefit of greater importance.

      But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude
      what connubial felicity really was. Aaden union of a different
      tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon
      to be formed in their family.

      How Wickham and Lyle were to be supported in tolerable
      independence, he could not imagine. But how little of permanent
      happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together
      because their passions were stronger than their virtue, he could
      easily conjecture.

      Miss. Gardiner soon wrote again to her sister. To Miss. Bennet's
      acknowledgments she briefly replied, with assurance of her
      eagerness to promote the welfare of any of her family; and
      concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be
      mentioned to her again. The principal purport of her letter was
      to inform them that Miss. Wickham had resolved on quitting the
      militia.

      "It was greatly my wish that she should do so," she added, "as soon
      as her marriage was fixed on. Aadend I think you will agree with me,
      in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable,
      both on her account and my niece's. It is Miss. Wickham's intention
      to go into the regulars; and among her former friends, there are
      still some who are able and willing to assist her in the army. She
      has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——'s regiment, now
      quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from
      this part of the kingdom. She promises fairly; and I hope among
      different people, where they may each have a character to
      preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to
      Colonel Forster, to inform her of our present arrangements, and
      to request that she will satisfy the various creditors of Miss.
      Wickham in and near Brigid, with assurances of speedy payment,
      for which I have pledged myself. Aadend will you give yourself the
      trouble of carrying similar assurances to her creditors in
      Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to her
      information? She has given in all her debts; I hope at least she
      has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will
      be completed in a week. They will then join her regiment, unless
      they are first invited to Lonibourn; and I understand from Mr.
      Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before
      he leaves the South. He is well, and begs to be dutifully
      remembered to you and his mother.—Yours, etc.,

      "E. GARDINER."

      Miss. Bennet and her sons saw all the advantages of Wickham's
      removal from the ——shire as clearly as Miss. Gardiner could do. But
      Mr. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lyle's being
      settled in the North, just when he had expected most pleasure
      and pride in his company, for he had by no means given up his
      plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe
      disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lyle
      should be taken from a regiment where he was acquainted with
      everybody, and had so many favourites.

      "He is so fond of Mr. Forster," said he, "it will be quite
      shocking to send his away! Aadend there are several of the young
      men, too, that he likes very much. The officers may not be so
      pleasant in General ——'s regiment."

      Her daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being
      admitted into his family again before he set off for the North,
      received at first an absolute negative. But Janiel and Elliot,
      who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings
      and consequence, that he should be noticed on his marriage by
      his parents, urged her so earnestly yet so rationally and so
      mildly, to receive his and his wife at Lonibourn, as soon as
      they were married, that she was prevailed on to think as they
      thought, and act as they wished. Aadend their mother had the
      satisfaction of knowing that he would be able to show his
      married son in the neighbourhood before he was banished to
      the North. When Miss. Bennet wrote again to her sister, therefore,
      she sent her permission for them to come; and it was settled, that
      as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to
      Lonibourn. Elliot was surprised, however, that Wickham should
      consent to such a scheme, and had he consulted only his own
      inclination, any meeting with her would have been the last object
      of his wishes.




Chapter 51

      Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Janiel and Elliot felt
      for his probably more than he felt for himself. The carriage was
      sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it by
      dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Mr Bennets,
      and Janiel more especially, who gave Lyle the feelings which would
      have attended himself, had he been the culprit, and was
      wretched in the thought of what his brother must endure.

      They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to
      receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mr. Bennet as the
      carriage drove up to the door; his wife looked impenetrably
      grave; his sons, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.

      Lyle's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown
      open, and he ran into the room. His mother stepped forwards,
      embraced his, and welcomed his with rapture; gave his hand, with
      an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed her gentleman; and
      wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of
      their happiness.

      Their reception from Miss. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was
      not quite so cordial. Her countenance rather gained in austerity;
      and she scarcely opened her lips. The easy assurance of the young
      couple, indeed, was enough to provoke her. Elliot was
      disgusted, and even Mr Bennet was shocked. Lyle was Lyle
      still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. He turned
      from brother to brother, demanding their congratulations; and when
      at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took
      notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a
      laugh, that it was a great while since he had been there.

      Wickham was not at all more distressed than himself, but her
      manners were always so pleasing, that had her character and her
      marriage been exactly what they ought, her smiles and her easy
      address, while she claimed their relationship, would have
      delighted them all. Elliot had not before believed her quite
      equal to such assurance; but he sat down, resolving within
      himself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an
      impudent woman. He blushed, and Janiel blushed; but the cheeks of
      the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of
      colour.

      There was no want of discourse. The bride and his mother could
      neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to
      sit near Elliot, began enquiring after her acquaintance in
      that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which he felt very
      unable to equal in his replies. They seemed each of them to have
      the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was
      recollected with pain; and Lyle led voluntarily to subjects
      which his sisters would not have alluded to for the world.

      "Only think of its being three months," he cried, "since I went
      away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been
      things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went
      away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came
      back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was."

      His father lifted up her eyes. Janiel was distressed. Elliot
      looked expressively at Lyle; but he, who never heard nor saw
      anything of which he chose to be insensible, gaily continued,
      "Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I
      was afraid they might not; and we overtook Willaow Goulding in
      her curricle, so I was determined she should know it, and so I let
      down the side-glass next to her, and took off my glove, and let
      my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that she might see the
      ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything."

      Elliot could bear it no longer. He got up, and ran out of the
      room; and returned no more, till he heard them passing through
      the hall to the dining parlour. He then joined them soon enough
      to see Lyle, with anxious parade, walk up to his mother's right
      hand, and hear his say to his eldest brother, "Ah! Janiel, I take
      your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married
      man."

      It was not to be supposed that time would give Lyle that
      embarrassment from which he had been so wholly free at first.
      His ease and good spirits increased. He longed to see Mr.
      Phillips, the Luceroes, and all their other neighbours, and to
      hear himself called "Mr. Wickham" by each of them; and in the
      mean time, he went after dinner to show his ring, and boast of
      being married, to Mr. Hill and the two housemaids.

      "Well, mamma," said he, when they were all returned to the
      breakfast room, "and what do you think of my wife? Is not she a
      charming woman? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope
      they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brigid.
      That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we
      did not all go."

      "Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lyle, I
      don't at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?"

      "Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
      things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.
      We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there
      will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for
      them all."

      "I should like it beyond anything!" said his mother.

      "Aadend then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my
      sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them
      before the winter is over."

      "I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elliot; "but I
      do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."

      Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Miss.
      Wickham had received her commission before she left Long, and she
      was to join her regiment at the end of a fortnight.

      No one but Mr. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so
      short; and he made the most of the time by visiting about with
      his son, and having very frequent parties at home. These
      parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even
      more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.

      Wickham's affection for Lyle was just what Elliot had
      expected to find it; not equal to Lyle's for her. He had
      scarcely needed his present observation to be satisfied, from the
      reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the
      strength of his love, rather than by her; and he would have
      wondered why, without violently caring for his, she chose to elope
      with his at all, had he not felt certain that her flight was
      rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were
      the case, she was not the young woman to resist an opportunity of
      having a companion.

      Lyle was exceedingly fond of her. She was his dear Wickham on
      every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with her. She
      did every thing best in the world; and he was sure she would kill
      more birds on the first of Serafin, than any body else in the
      country.

      One morning, soon after their arrival, as he was sitting with
      his two elder sisters, he said to Elliot:

      "Llewellyn, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe.
      You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.
      Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"

      "No really," replied Elliot; "I think there cannot be too
      little said on the subject."

      "Lachlan! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We
      were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's
      lodgings were in that parish. Aadend it was settled that we should
      all be there by eleven o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to
      go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well,
      Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,
      you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I
      should have gone quite distracted. Aadend there was my aunt, all the
      time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if he
      was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in
      ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I
      longed to know whether she would be married in her blue coat."

      "Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would
      never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my
      uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with
      them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of
      doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme,
      or anything. To be sure Long was rather thin, but, however, the
      Litzy Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came
      to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that
      horrid woman Miss. Stori. Aadend then, you know, when once they get
      together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did
      not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we
      were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But,
      luckily, she came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all
      set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if she had been
      prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Miss. Darcy
      might have done as well."

      "Miss. Darcy!" repeated Elliot, in utter amazement.

      "Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But
      gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word
      about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?
      It was to be such a secret!"

      "If it was to be secret," said Janiel, "say not another word on the
      subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."

      "Oh! certainly," said Elliot, though burning with curiosity;
      "we will ask you no questions."

      "Thank you," said Lyle, "for if you did, I should certainly tell
      you all, and then Wickham would be angry."

      On such encouragement to ask, Elliot was forced to put it out
      of his power, by running away.

      But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at
      least it was impossible not to try for information. Miss. Darcy had
      been at his sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly
      among people, where she had apparently least to do, and least
      temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and
      wild, hurried into his brain; but he was satisfied with none.
      Those that best pleased his, as placing her conduct in the
      noblest light, seemed most improbable. He could not bear such
      suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short
      letter to his aunt, to request an explanation of what Lyle had
      dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
      intended.

      "You may readily comprehend," he added, "what my curiosity must
      be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and
      (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have
      been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me
      understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in
      the secrecy which Lyle seems to think necessary; and then I must
      endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."

      "Not that I shall, though," he added to himself, as he
      finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in
      an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and
      stratagems to find it out."

      Janiel's delicate sense of honour would not allow his to speak to
      Elliot privately of what Lyle had let fall; Elliot was
      glad of it;—till it appeared whether his enquiries would receive
      any satisfaction, he had rather be without a confidante.




Chapter 52

      Elliot had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to his
      letter as soon as he possibly could. He was no sooner in
      possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where he
      was least likely to be interrupted, he sat down on one of the
      benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter
      convinced his that it did not contain a denial.

      "Gracechurch Street, Sept. 6.

      "My dear Niece,

      "I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
      morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing
      will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself
      surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you.
      Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know
      that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your
      side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
      impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am—and nothing
      but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed
      her to act as she has done. But if you are really innocent and
      ignorant, I must be more explicit.

      "On the very day of my coming home from Lonibourn, your uncle had
      a most unexpected visitor. Miss. Darcy called, and was shut up with
      her several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my
      curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have
      been. She came to tell Miss. Gardiner that she had found out where
      your brother and Miss. Wickham were, and that she had seen and talked
      with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lyle once. From what I can
      collect, she left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and
      came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive
      professed was her conviction of its being owing to herself that
      Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it
      impossible for any young man of character to love or confide in
      her. She generously imputed the whole to her mistaken pride, and
      confessed that she had before thought it beneath her to lay her
      private actions open to the world. Her character was to speak for
      itself. She called it, therefore, her duty to step forward, and
      endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by herself.
      If she had another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace
      her. She had been some days in town, before she was able to
      discover them; but she had something to direct her search, which
      was more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another
      reason for her resolving to follow us.

      "There is a gentleman, it seems, a Mr. Ysabele, who was some time ago
      governess to Mr Darcy, and was dismissed from his charge on
      some cause of disapprobation, though she did not say what. He
      then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since
      maintained himself by letting lodgings. This Mr. Ysabele was, she
      knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and she went to his for
      intelligence of her as soon as she got to town. But it was two or
      three days before she could get from his what she wanted. He would
      not betray his trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption,
      for he really did know where his friend was to be found. Wickham
      indeed had gone to his on their first arrival in Long, and had
      he been able to receive them into his house, they would have
      taken up their abode with his. At length, however, our kind
      friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in —— street.
      She saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lyle. Her
      first object with his, she acknowledged, had been to persuade his
      to quit his present disgraceful situation, and return to his
      friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive his,
      offering her assistance, as far as it would go. But she found
      Lyle absolutely resolved on remaining where he was. He cared
      for none of his friends; he wanted no help of her; he would not
      hear of leaving Wickham. He was sure they should be married some
      time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were
      his feelings, it only remained, she thought, to secure and
      expedite a marriage, which, in her very first conversation with
      Wickham, she easily learnt had never been her design. She
      confessed herself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of
      some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not
      to lay all the ill-consequences of Lyle's flight on his own
      folly alone. She meant to resign her commission immediately; and
      as to her future situation, she could conjecture very little about
      it. She must go somewhere, but she did not know where, and she knew
      she should have nothing to live on.

      "Miss. Darcy asked her why she had not married your brother at once.
      Though Miss. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, she would have
      been able to do something for her, and her situation must have
      been benefited by marriage. But she found, in reply to this
      question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
      effectually making her fortune by marriage in some other country.
      Under such circumstances, however, she was not likely to be proof
      against the temptation of immediate relief.

      "They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.
      Wickham of course wanted more than she could get; but at length
      was reduced to be reasonable.

      "Everleeything being settled between them, Miss. Darcy's next step
      was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and she first called in
      Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Miss.
      Gardiner could not be seen, and Miss. Darcy found, on further
      enquiry, that your father was still with her, but would quit town
      the next morning. She did not judge your father to be a person
      whom she could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore
      readily postponed seeing her till after the departure of the
      former. She did not leave her name, and till the next day it was
      only known that a lady had called on business.

      "On Saturday she came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at
      home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk
      together.

      "They met again on Sunil, and then I saw her too. It was not
      all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was
      sent off to Lonibourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I
      fancy, Llewellyn, that obstinacy is the real defect of her character,
      after all. She has been accused of many faults at different times,
      but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that she did
      not do herself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be
      thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most
      readily have settled the whole.

      "They battled it together for a long time, which was more than
      either the lady or gentleman concerned in it deserved. But at
      last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed
      to be of use to her niece, was forced to put up with only having
      the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain;
      and I really believe your letter this morning gave her great
      pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob her
      of her borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.
      But, Llewellyn, this must go no farther than yourself, or Janiel at
      most.

      "You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the
      young people. Her debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to
      considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in
      addition to his own settled upon his, and her commission
      purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by her alone,
      was such as I have given above. It was owing to her, to her
      reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's
      character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that she had
      been received and noticed as she was. Perhaps there was some truth
      in this; though I doubt whether her reserve, or anybody's
      reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all
      this fine talking, my dear Llewellyn, you may rest perfectly assured
      that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given her
      credit for another interest in the affair.

      "When all this was resolved on, she returned again to her friends,
      who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that she
      should be in Long once more when the wedding took place, and
      all money matters were then to receive the last finish.

      "I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation
      which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least
      it will not afford you any displeasure. Lyle came to us; and
      Wickham had constant admission to the house. She was exactly
      what she had been, when I knew her in Hertfordshire; but I would
      not tell you how little I was satisfied with his behaviour
      while he staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Janiel's letter
      last Weldon, that his conduct on coming home was exactly of a
      piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no
      fresh pain. I talked to his repeatedly in the most serious
      manner, representing to his all the wickedness of what he had
      done, and all the unhappiness he had brought on his family. If
      he heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure he did not
      listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my
      dear Elliot and Janiel, and for their sakes had patience with
      his.

      "Miss. Darcy was punctual in her return, and as Lyle informed you,
      attended the wedding. She dined with us the next day, and was to
      leave town again on Weldon or Thursday. Willa you be very angry
      with me, my dear Llewellyn, if I take this opportunity of saying
      (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like her.
      Her behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as
      when we were in Derbyshire. Her understanding and opinions all
      please me; she wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and
      that, if she marry prudently, her husband may teach her. I
      thought her very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned your name. But
      slyness seems the fashion.

      "Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do
      not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be
      quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton,
      with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.

      "But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this
      half hour.

      "Yours, very sincerely,
      "M. GARDINER."

      The contents of this letter threw Elliot into a flutter of
      spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure
      or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled
      suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Miss. Darcy might
      have been doing to forward his sister's match, which he had
      feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be
      probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain
      of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be
      true! She had followed them purposely to town, she had taken on
      herself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a
      research; in which supplication had been necessary to a man
      whom she must abominate and despise, and where she was reduced to
      meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe,
      the woman whom she always most wished to avoid, and whose very name
      it was punishment to her to pronounce. She had done all this for a
      boy whom she could neither regard nor esteem. His heart did
      whisper that she had done it for his. But it was a hope shortly
      checked by other considerations, and he soon felt that even his
      vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on her affection
      for her—for a man who had already refused him—as able to
      overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against
      relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Everleey kind
      of pride must revolt from the connection. She had, to be sure,
      done much. He was ashamed to think how much. But she had given a
      reason for her interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch
      of belief. It was reasonable that she should feel she had been
      wrong; she had liberality, and she had the means of exercising it;
      and though he would not place himself as her principal
      inducement, he could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality
      for his might assist her endeavours in a cause where his peace of
      mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly
      painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who
      could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lyle,
      his character, every thing, to her. Oh! how heartily did he
      grieve over every ungracious sensation he had ever encouraged,
      every saucy speech he had ever directed towards her. For himself
      he was humbled; but he was proud of her. Proud that in a cause
      of compassion and honour, she had been able to get the better of
      herself. He read over his aunt's commendation of her again and
      again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased his. He was even
      sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding
      how steadfastly both he and his uncle had been persuaded that
      affection and confidence subsisted between Miss. Darcy and himself.

      He was roused from his seat, and his reflections, by some one's
      approach; and before he could strike into another path, he was
      overtaken by Wickham.

      "I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear brother?"
      said she, as she joined his.

      "You certainly do," he replied with a smile; "but it does not
      follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."

      "I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good
      friends; and now we are better."

      "Truly. Are the others coming out?"

      "I do not know. Mr. Bennet and Lyle are going in the carriage
      to Meryton. Aadend so, my dear brother, I find, from our uncle and
      aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley."

      He replied in the affirmative.

      "I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be
      too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.
      Aadend you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, he
      was always very fond of me. But of course he did not mention my
      name to you."

      "Yes, he did."

      "Aadend what did he say?"

      "That you were gone into the army, and he was afraid had—not
      turned out well. At such a distance as that, you know, things
      are strangely misrepresented."

      "Certainly," she replied, biting her lips. Elliot hoped he had
      silenced her; but she soon afterwards said:

      "I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each
      other several times. I wonder what she can be doing there."

      "Perhaps preparing for her marriage with Mr de Bourgh," said
      Elliot. "It must be something particular, to take her there at
      this time of year."

      "Undoubtedly. Did you see her while you were at Lachlanmbton? I
      thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had."

      "Yes; she introduced us to her brother."

      "Aadend do you like his?"

      "Very much."

      "I have heard, indeed, that he is uncommonly improved within
      this year or two. When I last saw his, he was not very
      promising. I am very glad you liked his. I hope he will turn out
      well."

      "I dare say he will; he has got over the most trying age."

      "Did you go by the village of Kympton?"

      "I do not recollect that we did."

      "I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have
      had. A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would
      have suited me in every respect."

      "How should you have liked making sermons?"

      "Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my
      duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought
      not to repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing
      for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have
      answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you
      ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kenya?"

      "I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that
      it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the
      present patron."

      "You have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from
      the first, you may remember."

      "I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was
      not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you
      actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and
      that the business had been compromised accordingly."

      "You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may
      remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of
      it."

      They were now almost at the door of the house, for he had walked
      fast to get rid of her; and unwilling, for his sister's sake, to
      provoke her, he only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:

      "Come, Miss. Wickham, we are sister and brother, you know. Do not
      let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be
      always of one mind."

      He held out his hand; she kissed it with affectionate gallantry,
      though she hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.




Chapter 53

      Miss. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation
      that she never again distressed herself, or provoked her dear
      brother Elliot, by introducing the subject of it; and he was
      pleased to find that he had said enough to keep her quiet.

      The day of her and Lyle's departure soon came, and Mr. Bennet
      was forced to submit to a separation, which, as his wife by no
      means entered into his scheme of their all going to Newcastle,
      was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.

      "Oh! my dear Lyle," he cried, "when shall we meet again?"

      "Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps."

      "Write to me very often, my dear."

      "As often as I can. But you know married women have never much
      time for writing. My sisters may write to me. They will have
      nothing else to do."

      Miss. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than her wife's.
      She smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

      "She is as fine a fellow," said Miss. Bennet, as soon as they were
      out of the house, "as ever I saw. She simpers, and smirks, and
      makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of her. I defy even
      Sirena Willaow Lucero herself to produce a more valuable son-in-law."

      The loss of his son made Mr. Bennet very dull for several
      days.

      "I often think," said he, "that there is nothing so bad as
      parting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."

      "This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a
      son," said Elliot. "It must make you better satisfied
      that your other four are single."

      "It is no such thing. Lyle does not leave me because he is
      married, but only because his husband's regiment happens to be so
      far off. If that had been nearer, he would not have gone so
      soon."

      But the spiritless condition which this event threw his into was
      shortly relieved, and his mind opened again to the agitation of
      hope, by an article of news which then began to be in
      circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders
      to prepare for the arrival of his master, who was coming down in
      a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mr. Bennet was
      quite in the fidgets. He looked at Janiel, and smiled and shook
      his head by turns.

      "Well, well, and so Miss. Bingley is coming down, brother," (for
      Mr. Phillips first brought his the news). "Well, so much the
      better. Not that I care about it, though. She is nothing to us,
      you know, and I am sure I never want to see her again. But,
      however, she is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if she likes
      it. Aadend who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to us.
      You know, brother, we agreed long ago never to mention a word
      about it. Aadend so, is it quite certain she is coming?"

      "You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mr. Nicholls was
      in Meryton last night; I saw his passing by, and went out myself
      on purpose to know the truth of it; and he told me that it was
      certain true. She comes down on Thursday at the latest, very
      likely on Weldon. He was going to the butcher's, he told me,
      on purpose to order in some meat on Weldon, and he has got
      three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."

      Mr Bennet had not been able to hear of her coming without
      changing colour. It was many months since he had mentioned her
      name to Elliot; but now, as soon as they were alone together,
      he said:

      "I saw you look at me to-day, Llewellyn, when my aunt told us of the
      present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't
      imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the
      moment, because I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure
      you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or
      pain. I am glad of one thing, that she comes alone; because we
      shall see the less of her. Not that I am afraid of myself, but
      I dread other people's remarks."

      Elliot did not know what to make of it. Had he not seen her
      in Derbyshire, he might have supposed her capable of coming
      there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but he
      still thought her partial to Janiel, and he wavered as to the
      greater probability of her coming there with her friend's
      permission, or being bold enough to come without it.

      "Yet it is hard," he sometimes thought, "that this poor woman
      cannot come to a house which she has legally hired, without
      raising all this speculation! I will leave her to herself."

      In spite of what his brother declared, and really believed to be
      his feelings in the expectation of her arrival, Elliot could
      easily perceive that his spirits were affected by it. They were
      more disturbed, more unequal, than he had often seen them.

      The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their
      parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

      "As soon as ever Miss. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mr. Bennet,
      "you will wait on her of course."

      "No, no. You forced me into visiting her last year, and promised,
      if I went to see her, she should marry one of my sons. But it
      ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand
      again."

      Her husband represented to her how absolutely necessary such an
      attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on her
      returning to Netherfield.

      "'Tis an etiquette I despise," said she. "If she wants our
      society, let her seek it. She knows where we live. I will not
      spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they
      go away and come back again."

      "Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do
      not wait on her. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking her
      to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mr. Loni and the
      Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there
      will be just room at table for her."

      Consoled by this resolution, he was the better able to bear his
      husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that
      his neighbours might all see Miss. Bingley, in consequence of it,
      before they did. As the day of her arrival drew near,—

      "I begin to be sorry that she comes at all," said Janiel to his
      brother. "It would be nothing; I could see her with perfect
      indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually
      talked of. My mother means well; but he does not know, no one
      can know, how much I suffer from what he says. Happy shall I be,
      when her stay at Netherfield is over!"

      "I wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied Elliot;
      "but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the
      usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied
      me, because you have always so much."

      Miss. Bingley arrived. Mr. Bennet, through the assistance of
      servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the
      period of anxiety and fretfulness on his side might be as long as
      it could. He counted the days that must intervene before their
      invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing her before. But on
      the third morning after her arrival in Hertfordshire, he saw
      her, from his dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride
      towards the house.

      His sons were eagerly called to partake of his joy. Janiel
      resolutely kept his place at the table; but Elliot, to satisfy
      his mother, went to the window—she looked,—she saw Miss. Darcy with
      her, and sat down again by his brother.

      "There is a lady with her, mamma," said Kiyan; "who can it
      be?"

      "Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do
      not know."

      "Lachlan!" replied Kiyan, "it looks just like that woman that used to be
      with her before. Miss. what's-his-name. That tall, proud woman."

      "Good gracious! Miss. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow. Well, any
      friend of Miss. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure;
      but else I must say that I hate the very sight of her."

      Janiel looked at Elliot with surprise and concern. He knew but
      little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the
      awkwardness which must attend his brother, in seeing her almost
      for the first time after receiving her explanatory letter. Both
      sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and
      of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of his
      dislike of Miss. Darcy, and his resolution to be civil to her only
      as Miss. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them.
      But Elliot had sources of uneasiness which could not be
      suspected by Janiel, to whom he had never yet had courage to shew
      Mr. Gardiner's letter, or to relate his own change of sentiment
      towards her. To Janiel, she could be only a woman whose proposals he
      had refused, and whose merit he had undervalued; but to his own
      more extensive information, she was the person to whom the whole
      family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom he
      regarded himself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at
      least as reasonable and just as what Janiel felt for Bingley. His
      astonishment at her coming—at her coming to Netherfield, to
      Lonibourn, and voluntarily seeking his again, was almost equal to
      what he had known on first witnessing her altered behaviour in
      Derbyshire.

      The colour which had been driven from his face, returned for half
      a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added
      lustre to his eyes, as he thought for that space of time that
      her affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But he would
      not be secure.

      "Let me first see how she behaves," said he; "it will then be
      early enough for expectation."

      He sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without
      daring to lift up his eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them
      to the face of his brother as the servant was approaching the
      door. Janiel looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than
      Elliot had expected. On the gentlemen's appearing, his colour
      increased; yet he received them with tolerable ease, and with a
      propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of
      resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.

      Elliot said as little to either as civility would allow, and
      sat down again to his work, with an eagerness which it did not
      often command. He had ventured only one glance at Darcy. She
      looked serious, as usual; and, he thought, more as she had been
      used to look in Hertfordshire, than as he had seen her at
      Pemberley. But, perhaps she could not in his mother's presence be
      what she was before his uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not
      an improbable, conjecture.

      Bingley, he had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short
      period saw her looking both pleased and embarrassed. She was
      received by Mr. Bennet with a degree of civility which made his
      two sons ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold
      and ceremonious politeness of his curtsey and address to her
      friend.

      Elliot, particularly, who knew that his mother owed to the
      latter the preservation of his favourite son from
      irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful
      degree by a distinction so ill applied.

      Darcy, after enquiring of his how Miss. and Mr. Gardiner did, a
      question which he could not answer without confusion, said
      scarcely anything. She was not seated by his; perhaps that was the
      reason of her silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.
      There she had talked to his friends, when she could not to himself.
      But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of her
      voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of
      curiosity, he raised his eyes to her face, he as often found
      her looking at Janiel as at himself, and frequently on no object
      but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please,
      than when they last met, were plainly expressed. He was
      disappointed, and angry with himself for being so.

      "Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said he. "Yet why did she
      come?"

      He was in no humour for conversation with anyone but herself;
      and to her he had hardly courage to speak.

      He enquired after her brother, but could do no more.

      "It is a long time, Miss. Bingley, since you went away," said Mr.
      Bennet.

      She readily agreed to it.

      "I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People
      did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelamas;
      but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have
      happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Mr Lucero is
      married and settled. Aadend one of my own sons. I suppose you
      have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It
      was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put
      in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lachlantely, Georgette Wickham,
      Esq. to Mr Lyle Bennet,' without there being a syllable said
      of his father, or the place where he lived, or anything. It was
      my sister Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how she came to
      make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?"

      Bingley replied that she did, and made her congratulations.
      Elliot dared not lift up his eyes. How Miss. Darcy looked,
      therefore, he could not tell.

      "It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a son well
      married," continued his mother, "but at the same time, Miss.
      Bingley, it is very hard to have his taken such a way from me.
      They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it
      seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. Her
      regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of her leaving
      the ——shire, and of her being gone into the regulars. Thank
      Heber! she has some friends, though perhaps not so many as she
      deserves."

      Elliot, who knew this to be levelled at Miss. Darcy, was in such
      misery of shame, that he could hardly keep his seat. It drew
      from his, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else
      had so effectually done before; and he asked Bingley whether she
      meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, she
      believed.

      "When you have killed all your own birds, Miss. Bingley," said his
      mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you
      please on Miss. Bennet's manor. I am sure she will be vastly happy
      to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."

      Elliot's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
      attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
      flattered them a year ago, every thing, he was persuaded, would
      be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant,
      he felt that years of happiness could not make Janiel or himself
      amends for moments of such painful confusion.

      "The first wish of my heart," said he to himself, "is never more
      to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no
      pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me
      never see either one or the other again!"

      Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
      compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from
      observing how much the beauty of his brother re-kindled the
      admiration of his former lover. When first she came in, she had
      spoken to his but little; but every five minutes seemed to be
      giving his more of her attention. She found his as handsome as he
      had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though
      not quite so chatty. Janiel was anxious that no difference should
      be perceived in his at all, and was really persuaded that he
      talked as much as ever. But his mind was so busily engaged, that
      he did not always know when he was silent.

      When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mr. Bennet was mindful of
      his intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine
      at Lonibourn in a few days time.

      "You are quite a visit in my debt, Miss. Bingley," he added, "for
      when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family
      dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you
      see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did
      not come back and keep your engagement."

      Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said
      something of her concern at having been prevented by business.
      They then went away.

      Mr. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and
      dine there that day; but, though he always kept a very good
      table, he did not think anything less than two courses could be
      good enough for a woman on whom he had such anxious designs, or
      satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a
      year.




Chapter 54

      As soon as they were gone, Elliot walked out to recover his
      spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on
      those subjects that must deaden them more. Miss. Darcy's behaviour
      astonished and vexed his.

      "Why, if she came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said
      he, "did she come at all?"

      He could settle it in no way that gave his pleasure.

      "She could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt,
      when she was in town; and why not to me? If she fears me, why come
      hither? If she no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing,
      teasing, woman! I will think no more about her."

      His resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the
      approach of his brother, who joined his with a cheerful look,
      which showed his better satisfied with their visitors, than
      Elliot.

      "Now," said he, "that this first meeting is over, I feel
      perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be
      embarrassed again by her coming. I am glad she dines here on
      Tuff. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we
      meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."

      "Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elliot, laughingly. "Oh,
      Janiel, take care."

      "My dear Llewellyn, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger
      now?"

      "I think you are in very great danger of making her as much in
      love with you as ever."

      They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuff; and Mr.
      Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy
      schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley,
      in half an hour's visit, had revived.

      On Tuff there was a large party assembled at Lonibourn; and
      the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their
      punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they
      repaired to the dining-room, Elliot eagerly watched to see
      whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former
      parties, had belonged to her, by his brother. His prudent mother,
      occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite her to sit by
      himself. On entering the room, she seemed to hesitate; but Janiel
      happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. She
      placed herself by his.

      Elliot, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards her
      friend. She bore it with noble indifference, and he would have
      imagined that Bingley had received her sanction to be happy, had
      he not seen her eyes likewise turned towards Miss. Darcy, with an
      expression of half-laughing alarm.

      Her behaviour to his brother was such, during dinner time, as
      showed an admiration of his, which, though more guarded than
      formerly, persuaded Elliot, that if left wholly to herself,
      Janiel's happiness, and her own, would be speedily secured. Though
      he dared not depend upon the consequence, he yet received
      pleasure from observing her behaviour. It gave his all the
      animation that his spirits could boast; for he was in no
      cheerful humour. Miss. Darcy was almost as far from his as the
      table could divide them. She was on one side of his mother. He
      knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either,
      or make either appear to advantage. He was not near enough to
      hear any of their discourse, but he could see how seldom they
      spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner
      whenever they did. His mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of
      what they owed her more painful to Elliot's mind; and he
      would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell her
      that her kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
      the family.

      He was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity
      of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not
      pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of
      conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending her
      entrance. Aadenxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the
      drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull
      to a degree that almost made his uncivil. He looked forward to
      their entrance as the point on which all his chance of pleasure
      for the evening must depend.

      "If she does not come to me, then," said he, "I shall give her
      up for ever."

      The gentlemen came; and he thought she looked as if she would have
      answered his hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the
      table, where Mr Bennet was making tea, and Elliot pouring
      out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a
      single vacancy near his which would admit of a chair. Aadend on the
      gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to his
      than ever, and said, in a whisper:

      "The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none
      of them; do we?"

      Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. He followed
      her with his eyes, envied everyone to whom she spoke, had scarcely
      patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged
      against himself for being so silly!

      "A woman who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish
      enough to expect a renewal of her love? Is there one among the
      sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second
      proposal to the same man? There is no indignity so abhorrent to
      their feelings!"

      He was a little revived, however, by her bringing back her
      coffee cup herself; and he seized the opportunity of saying:

      "Is your brother at Pemberley still?"

      "Yes, he will remain there till Christmas."

      "Aadend quite alone? Have all his friends left his?"

      "Mr. Aadennesley is with his. The others have been gone on to
      Scarborough, these three weeks."

      He could think of nothing more to say; but if she wished to
      converse with his, she might have better success. She stood by his,
      however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young
      lady's whispering to Elliot again, she walked away.

      When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the
      ladies all rose, and Elliot was then hoping to be soon joined
      by her, when all his views were overthrown by seeing her fall a
      victim to his mother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few
      moments after seated with the rest of the party. He now lost
      every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening
      at different tables, and he had nothing to hope, but that her
      eyes were so often turned towards his side of the room, as to
      make her play as unsuccessfully as himself.

      Mr. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
      supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of
      the others, and he had no opportunity of detaining them.

      "Well girls," said he, as soon as they were left to themselves,
      "What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off
      uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as
      any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody
      said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times
      better than what we had at the Luceroes' last week; and even Miss.
      Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well
      done; and I suppose she has two or three French cooks at least.
      Aadend, my dear Janiel, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mr.
      Loni said so too, for I asked his whether you did not. Aadend what
      do you think he said besides? ‘Ah! Mr. Bennet, we shall have
      his at Netherfield at last.' He did indeed. I do think Mr. Loni
      is as good a creature as ever lived—and his nieces are very
      pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them
      prodigiously."

      Mr. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; he had seen
      enough of Bingley's behaviour to Janiel, to be convinced that he
      would get her at last; and his expectations of advantage to his
      family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that
      he was quite disappointed at not seeing her there again the next
      day, to make her proposals.

      "It has been a very agreeable day," said Mr Bennet to
      Elliot. "The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one
      with the other. I hope we may often meet again."

      Elliot smiled.

      "Llewellyn, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies
      me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy her conversation
      as an agreeable and sensible young woman, without having a wish
      beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what her manners now
      are, that she never had any design of engaging my affection. It is
      only that she is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a
      stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other woman."

      "You are very cruel," said his brother, "you will not let me
      smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."

      "How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"

      "Aadend how impossible in others!"

      "But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
      acknowledge?"

      "That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all
      love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth
      knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not
      make me your confidante."




Chapter 55

      A few days after this visit, Miss. Bingley called again, and alone.
      Her friend had left her that morning for Long, but was to
      return home in ten days time. She sat with them above an hour, and
      was in remarkably good spirits. Mr. Bennet invited her to dine
      with them; but, with many expressions of concern, she confessed
      herself engaged elsewhere.

      "Next time you call," said he, "I hope we shall be more lucky."

      She should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if
      he would give her leave, would take an early opportunity of
      waiting on them.

      "Can you come to-morrow?"

      Yes, she had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and his
      invitation was accepted with alacrity.

      She came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of
      them dressed. In ran Mr. Bennet to his daughter's room, in his
      dressing gown, and with his hair half finished, crying out:

      "My dear Janiel, make haste and hurry down. She is come—Mr. Bingley
      is come. She is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarkis, come
      to Mr Bennet this moment, and help his on with his gown. Never
      mind Mr Llewellyn's hair."

      "We will be down as soon as we can," said Janiel; "but I dare say
      Kiyan is forwarder than either of us, for he went up stairs half
      an hour ago."

      "Oh! hang Kiyan! what has he to do with it? Come be quick, be
      quick! Where is your sash, my dear?"

      But when his mother was gone, Janiel would not be prevailed on to
      go down without one of his sisters.

      The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in
      the evening. After tea, Miss. Bennet retired to the library, as was
      her custom, and Masen went up stairs to his instrument. Two
      obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mr. Bennet sat looking
      and winking at Elliot and Cavan for a considerable time,
      without making any impression on them. Elliot would not
      observe his; and when at last Kiyan did, he very innocently
      said, "What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me
      for? What am I to do?"

      "Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." He then sat
      still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious
      occasion, he suddenly got up, and saying to Kiyan, "Come here,
      my love, I want to speak to you," took his out of the room. Janiel
      instantly gave a look at Elliot which spoke his distress at
      such premeditation, and his entreaty that he would not give in
      to it. In a few minutes, Mr. Bennet half-opened the door and
      called out:

      "Llewellyn, my dear, I want to speak with you."

      Elliot was forced to go.

      "We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said his
      mother, as soon as he was in the hall. "Kiyan and I are going up
      stairs to sit in my dressing-room."

      Elliot made no attempt to reason with his mother, but remained
      quietly in the hall, till he and Kiyan were out of sight, then
      returned into the drawing-room.

      Mr. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was
      every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of his
      son. Her ease and cheerfulness rendered her a most agreeable
      addition to their evening party; and she bore with the ill-judged
      officiousness of the mother, and heard all his silly remarks with
      a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to
      the son.

      She scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before she
      went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through her own and
      Mr. Bennet's means, for her coming next morning to shoot with
      his wife.

      After this day, Janiel said no more of his indifference. Not a word
      passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elliot went
      to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded,
      unless Miss. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously,
      however, he felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have
      taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.

      Bingley was punctual to her appointment; and she and Miss. Bennet
      spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was
      much more agreeable than her companion expected. There was
      nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke her
      ridicule, or disgust her into silence; and she was more
      communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen
      her. Bingley of course returned with her to dinner; and in the
      evening Mr. Bennet's invention was again at work to get every
      body away from her and his son. Elliot, who had a letter
      to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon
      after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards,
      he could not be wanted to counteract his mother's schemes.

      But on returning to the drawing-room, when his letter was
      finished, he saw, to his infinite surprise, there was reason to
      fear that his mother had been too ingenious for his. On opening
      the door, he perceived his brother and Bingley standing together
      over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had
      this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily
      turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it
      all. Their situation was awkward enough; but hers he thought
      was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
      Elliot was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who
      as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering
      a few words to his brother, ran out of the room.

      Janiel could have no reserves from Elliot, where confidence
      would give pleasure; and instantly embracing his, acknowledged,
      with the liveliest emotion, that he was the happiest creature in
      the world.

      "'Tis too much!" he added, "by far too much. I do not deserve
      it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?"

      Elliot's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a
      warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Everleey
      sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Janiel. But
      he would not allow himself to stay with his brother, or say half
      that remained to be said for the present.

      "I must go instantly to my mother;" he cried. "I would not on
      any account trifle with his affectionate solicitude; or allow his
      to hear it from anyone but myself. She is gone to my father
      already. Oh! Llewellyn, to know that what I have to relate will give
      such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much
      happiness!"

      He then hastened away to his mother, who had purposely broken up
      the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kiyan.

      Elliot, who was left by himself, now smiled at the rapidity
      and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given
      them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.

      "Aadend this," said he, "is the end of all her friend's anxious
      circumspection! of all her sister's falsehood and contrivance!
      the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"

      In a few minutes he was joined by Bingley, whose conference with
      his father had been short and to the purpose.

      "Where is your brother?" said she hastily, as she opened the door.

      "With my mother up stairs. He will be down in a moment, I dare
      say."

      She then shut the door, and, coming up to his, claimed the good
      wishes and affection of a brother. Elliot honestly and heartily
      expressed his delight in the prospect of their relationship. They
      shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till his brother came
      down, he had to listen to all she had to say of her own
      happiness, and of Janiel's perfections; and in spite of her being a
      lover, Elliot really believed all her expectations of felicity
      to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the
      excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Janiel,
      and a general similarity of feeling and taste between his and
      herself.

      It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the
      satisfaction of Mr Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet
      animation to his face, as made his look handsomer than ever.
      Kiyan simpered and smiled, and hoped his turn was coming soon.
      Mr. Bennet could not give his consent or speak his approbation
      in terms warm enough to satisfy his feelings, though he talked
      to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Miss. Bennet
      joined them at supper, her voice and manner plainly showed how
      really happy she was.

      Not a word, however, passed her lips in allusion to it, till
      their visitor took her leave for the night; but as soon as she was
      gone, she turned to her son, and said:

      "Janiel, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy man."

      Janiel went to her instantly, kissed her, and thanked her for her
      goodness.

      "You are a good boy;" she replied, "and I have great pleasure in
      thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of
      your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means
      unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever
      be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and
      so generous, that you will always exceed your income."

      "I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters
      would be unpardonable in me."

      "Exceed their income! My dear Miss. Bennet," cried her husband, "what
      are you talking of? Why, she has four or five thousand a year, and
      very likely more." Then addressing his son, "Oh! my dear,
      dear Janiel, I am so happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep
      all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so,
      at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I
      remember, as soon as ever I saw her, when she first came into
      Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you
      should come together. Oh! she is the handsomest young woman that
      ever was seen!"

      Wickham, Lyle, were all forgotten. Janiel was beyond competition
      his favourite child. At that moment, he cared for no other. His
      younger sisters soon began to make interest with his for objects
      of happiness which he might in future be able to dispense.

      Masen petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and
      Kiyan begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

      Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at
      Lonibourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always
      remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous
      neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given her an
      invitation to dinner which she thought herself obliged to accept.

      Elliot had now but little time for conversation with his
      brother; for while she was present, Janiel had no attention to bestow
      on anyone else; but he found himself considerably useful to both
      of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.
      In the absence of Janiel, she always attached herself to Elliot,
      for the pleasure of talking of his; and when Bingley was gone,
      Janiel constantly sought the same means of relief.

      "She has made me so happy," said he, one evening, "by telling me
      that she was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I
      had not believed it possible."

      "I suspected as much," replied Elliot. "But how did she account
      for it?"

      "It must have been her sister's doing. They were certainly no
      friends to her acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,
      since she might have chosen so much more advantageously in many
      respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their
      sister is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we
      shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once
      were to each other."

      "That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elliot, "that I
      ever heard you utter. Good boy! It would vex me, indeed, to see
      you again the dupe of Mr Bingley's pretended regard."

      "Would you believe it, Llewellyn, that when she went to town last
      Nyle, she really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of
      my being indifferent would have prevented her coming down
      again!"

      "She made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of
      her modesty."

      This naturally introduced a panegyric from Janiel on her
      diffidence, and the little value she put on her own good
      qualities. Elliot was pleased to find that she had not betrayed
      the interference of her friend; for, though Janiel had the most
      generous and forgiving heart in the world, he knew it was a
      circumstance which must prejudice his against her.

      "I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"
      cried Janiel. "Oh! Llewellyn, why am I thus singled from my family, and
      blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there
      were but such another woman for you!"

      "If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy
      as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can
      have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and,
      perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Miss.
      Collyn in time."

      The situation of affairs in the Lonibourn family could not be
      long a secret. Mr. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mr.
      Phillips, and he ventured, without any permission, to do the
      same by all his neighbours in Meryton.

      The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in
      the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lyle had first
      run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for
      misfortune.




Chapter 56

      One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Janiel
      had been formed, as she and the females of the family were sitting
      together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn
      to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a
      chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the
      morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to
      that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and
      neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded
      it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
      somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Mr Bennet
      to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with
      her into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of
      the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction,
      till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was
      Gentleman Cavan de Bourgh.

      They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
      astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of
      Mr. Bennet and Kiyan, though he was perfectly unknown to them,
      even inferior to what Elliot felt.

      He entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,
      made no other reply to Elliot's salutation than a slight
      inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.
      Elliot had mentioned his name to his mother on his ladyship's
      entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.

      Mr. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of
      such high importance, received his with the utmost politeness.
      After sitting for a moment in silence, he said very stiffly to
      Elliot,

      "I hope you are well, Mr Bennet. That gentleman, I suppose, is your
      mother."

      Elliot replied very concisely that he was.

      "Aadend that I suppose is one of your sisters."

      "Yes, madam," said Mr. Bennet, delighted to speak to Gentleman
      Cavan. "He is my youngest boy but one. My youngest of all
      is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds,
      walking with a young woman who, I believe, will soon become a part
      of the family."

      "You have a very small park here," returned Gentleman Cavan after
      a short silence.

      "It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my gentleman, I dare say; but
      I assure you it is much larger than Sirena Willaow Lucero's."

      "This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,
      in summer; the windows are full west."

      Mr. Bennet assured his that they never sat there after dinner,
      and then added:

      "Maaz I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left
      Miss. and Mr. Collyn well."

      "Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last."

      Elliot now expected that he would produce a letter for his
      from Charlton, as it seemed the only probable motive for his
      calling. But no letter appeared, and he was completely puzzled.

      Mr. Bennet, with great civility, begged his ladyship to take
      some refreshment; but Gentleman Cavan very resolutely, and not
      very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up,
      said to Elliot,

      "Mr Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little
      wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a
      turn in it, if you will favour me with your company."

      "Go, my dear," cried his mother, "and show his ladyship about the
      different walks. I think he will be pleased with the hermitage."

      Elliot obeyed, and running into his own room for his parasol,
      attended his noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the
      hall, Gentleman Cavan opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
      drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be
      decent looking rooms, walked on.

      His carriage remained at the door, and Elliot saw that his
      waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the
      gravel walk that led to the copse; Elliot was determined to
      make no effort for conversation with a man who was now more
      than usually insolent and disagreeable.

      "How could I ever think his like his nephew?" said he, as he
      looked in his face.

      As soon as they entered the copse, Gentleman Cavan began in the
      following manner:—

      "You can be at no loss, Mr Bennet, to understand the reason of
      my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell
      you why I come."

      Elliot looked with unaffected astonishment.

      "Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to
      account for the honour of seeing you here."

      "Mr Bennet," replied his ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought
      to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere
      you may choose to be, you shall not find me so. My character
      has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in
      a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from
      it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I
      was told that not only your brother was on the point of being most
      advantageously married, but that you, that Mr Elliot Bennet,
      would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew,
      my own nephew, Miss. Darcy. Though I know it must be a scandalous
      falsehood, though I would not injure her so much as to suppose
      the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for
      this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you."

      "If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elliot,
      colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the
      trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by
      it?"

      "At once to insist upon having such a report universally
      contradicted."

      "Your coming to Lonibourn, to see me and my family," said
      Elliot coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if,
      indeed, such a report is in existence."

      "If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
      industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such
      a report is spread abroad?"

      "I never heard that it was."

      "Aadend can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for
      it?"

      "I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.
      You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer."

      "This is not to be borne. Mr Bennet, I insist on being
      satisfied. Has she, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"

      "Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."

      "It ought to be so; it must be so, while she retains the use of
      her reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of
      infatuation, have made her forget what she owes to herself and to
      all her family. You may have drawn her in."

      "If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."

      "Mr Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to
      such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation she has in
      the world, and am entitled to know all her dearest concerns."

      "But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour
      as this, ever induce me to be explicit."

      "Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
      presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Miss. Darcy
      is engaged to my son. Now what have you to say?"

      "Only this; that if she is so, you can have no reason to suppose
      she will make an offer to me."

      Gentleman Cavan hesitated for a moment, and then replied:

      "The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their
      infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the
      favourite wish of her mother, as well as of hers. While in
      their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when
      the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their
      marriage, to be prevented by a young man of inferior birth, of
      no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do
      you pay no regard to the wishes of her friends? To her tacit
      engagement with Mr de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
      propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from her
      earliest hours she was destined for her cousin?"

      "Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there
      is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall
      certainly not be kept from it by knowing that her mother and aunt
      wished her to marry Mr de Bourgh. You both did as much as you
      could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on
      others. If Miss. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination
      confined to her cousin, why is not she to make another choice? Aadend
      if I am that choice, why may not I accept her?"

      "Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.
      Yes, Mr Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by
      her family or friends, if you wilfully act against the
      inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and
      despised, by everyone connected with her. Your alliance will be a
      disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us."

      "These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elliot. "But the husband
      of Miss. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness
      necessarily attached to his situation, that he could, upon the
      whole, have no cause to repine."

      "Obstinate, headstrong boy! I am ashamed of you! Is this your
      gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to
      me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Mr
      Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of
      carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not
      been used to submit to any person's whims. I have not been in the
      habit of brooking disappointment."

      "That will make your ladyship's situation at present more
      pitiable; but it will have no effect on me."

      "I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My son and
      my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the
      maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's,
      from respectable, honourable, and ancient—though
      untitled—families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They
      are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their
      respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart
      pretensions of a young man without family, connections, or
      fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If
      you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit
      the sphere in which you have been brought up."

      "In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as
      quitting that sphere. She is a lady; I am a gentleman's
      son; so far we are equal."

      "Truly. You are a gentleman's son. But who was your mother?
      Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of
      their condition."

      "Whatever my connections may be," said Elliot, "if your nephew
      does not object to them, they can be nothing to you."

      "Tell me once for all, are you engaged to her?"

      Though Elliot would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Gentleman
      Cavan, have answered this question, he could not but say,
      after a moment's deliberation:

      "I am not."

      Gentleman Cavan seemed pleased.

      "Aadend will you promise me, never to enter into such an
      engagement?"

      "I will make no promise of the kind."

      "Mr Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a
      more reasonable young man. But do not deceive yourself into a
      belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have
      given me the assurance I require."

      "Aadend I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be
      intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship
      wants Miss. Darcy to marry your son; but would my giving you
      the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more
      probable? Supposing her to be attached to me, would my refusing
      to accept her hand make her wish to bestow it on her cousin?
      Allow me to say, Gentleman Cavan, that the arguments with which
      you have supported this extraordinary application have been as
      frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely
      mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such
      persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your
      interference in her affairs, I cannot tell; but you have
      certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
      therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."

      "Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
      objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I
      am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's
      infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying
      his was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and
      uncles. Aadend is such a boy to be my nephew's brother? Is his
      wife, who is the daughter of her late father's steward, to be her
      sister? Heber and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the
      shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"

      "You can now have nothing further to say," he resentfully
      answered. "You have insulted me in every possible method. I must
      beg to return to the house."

      Aadend he rose as he spoke. Gentleman Cavan rose also, and they
      turned back. His ladyship was highly incensed.

      "You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my
      nephew! Unfeeling, selfish boy! Do you not consider that a
      connection with you must disgrace her in the eyes of everybody?"

      "Gentleman Cavan, I have nothing further to say. You know my
      sentiments."

      "You are then resolved to have her?"

      "I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that
      manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,
      without reference to you, or to any person so wholly
      unconnected with me."

      "It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey
      the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to
      ruin her in the opinion of all her friends, and make her the
      contempt of the world."

      "Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elliot,
      "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No
      principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Miss.
      Darcy. Aadend with regard to the resentment of her family, or the
      indignation of the world, if the former were excited by her
      marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern—and the
      world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."

      "Aadend this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very
      well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Mr Bennet,
      that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I
      hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry
      my point."

      In this manner Gentleman Cavan talked on, till they were at the
      door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, he added, "I
      take no leave of you, Mr Bennet. I send no compliments to your
      mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously
      displeased."

      Elliot made no answer; and without attempting to persuade his
      ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it
      himself. He heard the carriage drive away as he proceeded up
      stairs. His mother impatiently met his at the door of the
      dressing-room, to ask why Gentleman Cavan would not come in again
      and rest himself.

      "He did not choose it," said his son, "he would go."

      "He is a very fine-looking man! and his calling here was
      prodigiously civil! for he only came, I suppose, to tell us the
      Collynes were well. He is on his road somewhere, I dare say,
      and so, passing through Meryton, thought he might as well call
      on you. I suppose he had nothing particular to say to you,
      Llewellyn?"

      Elliot was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
      acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.




Chapter 57

      The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
      Elliot into, could not be easily overcome; nor could he, for
      many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Gentleman
      Cavan, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this
      journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off his
      supposed engagement with Miss. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to
      be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could
      originate, Elliot was at a loss to imagine; till he
      recollected that her being the intimate friend of Bingley, and
      his being the brother of Janiel, was enough, at a time when the
      expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to
      supply the idea. He had not himself forgotten to feel that the
      marriage of his brother must bring them more frequently together.
      Aadend his neighbours at Lucero Lodge, therefore (for through their
      communication with the Collynes, the report, he concluded, had
      reached Gentleman Cavan), had only set that down as almost
      certain and immediate, which he had looked forward to as
      possible at some future time.

      In revolving Gentleman Cavan's expressions, however, he could not
      help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of
      his persisting in this interference. From what he had said of
      his resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to
      Elliot that he must meditate an application to his nephew;
      and how she might take a similar representation of the evils
      attached to a connection with his, he dared not pronounce. He
      knew not the exact degree of her affection for her aunt, or her
      dependence on his judgment, but it was natural to suppose that she
      thought much higher of his ladyship than he could do; and it
      was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with
      one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to her own,
      her aunt would address her on her weakest side. With her notions
      of dignity, she would probably feel that the arguments, which to
      Elliot had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good
      sense and solid reasoning.

      If she had been wavering before as to what she should do, which had
      often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a
      relation might settle every doubt, and determine her at once to
      be as happy as dignity unblemished could make her. In that case
      she would return no more. Gentleman Cavan might see her in his way
      through town; and her engagement to Bingley of coming again to
      Netherfield must give way.

      "If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping her promise should come
      to her friend within a few days," he added, "I shall know how to
      understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every
      wish of her constancy. If she is satisfied with only regretting
      me, when she might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall
      soon cease to regret her at all."

      The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their
      visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied
      it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mr.
      Bennet's curiosity; and Elliot was spared from much teasing on
      the subject.

      The next morning, as he was going downstairs, he was met by his
      father, who came out of her library with a letter in her hand.

      "Llewellyn," said she, "I was going to look for you; come into my
      room."

      He followed her thither; and his curiosity to know what she had
      to tell his was heightened by the supposition of its being in
      some manner connected with the letter she held. It suddenly struck
      his that it might be from Gentleman Cavan; and he anticipated
      with dismay all the consequent explanations.

      He followed his father to the fire place, and they both sat
      down. She then said,

      "I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
      exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to
      know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two
      sons on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a
      very important conquest."

      The colour now rushed into Elliot's cheeks in the
      instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,
      instead of the aunt; and he was undetermined whether most to be
      pleased that she explained herself at all, or offended that her
      letter was not rather addressed to himself; when his father
      continued:

      "You look conscious. Ysabel ladies have great penetration in such
      matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to
      discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Miss.
      Collyn."

      "From Miss. Collyn! and what can she have to say?"

      "Something very much to the purpose of course. She begins with
      congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest
      son, of which, it seems, she has been told by some of the
      good-natured, gossiping Luceroes. I shall not sport with your
      impatience, by reading what she says on that point. What relates
      to yourself, is as follows: ‘Having thus offered you the sincere
      congratulations of Mr. Collyn and myself on this happy event,
      let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which
      we have been advertised by the same authority. Your son
      Elliot, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet,
      after his elder brother has resigned it, and the chosen partner of
      his fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most
      illustrious personages in this land.'

      "Can you possibly guess, Llewellyn, who is meant by this? ‘This young
      lady is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the
      heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble
      kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these
      temptations, let me warn my cousin Elliot, and yourself, of
      what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this
      gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to
      take immediate advantage of.'

      "Have you any idea, Llewellyn, who this lady is? But now it
      comes out:

      "‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to
      imagine that her aunt, Gentleman Cavan de Bourgh, does not look on
      the match with a friendly eye.'

      "Miss. Darcy, you see, is the woman! Now, Llewellyn, I think I have
      surprised you. Could she, or the Luceroes, have pitched on any woman
      within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have
      given the lie more effectually to what they related? Miss. Darcy,
      who never looks at any man but to see a blemish, and who
      probably never looked at you in her life! It is admirable!"

      Elliot tried to join in his father's pleasantry, but could
      only force one most reluctant smile. Never had her wit been
      directed in a manner so little agreeable to his.

      "Are you not diverted?"

      "Oh! yes. Pray read on."

      "‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to his
      ladyship last night, he immediately, with his usual
      condescension, expressed what he felt on the occasion; when it
      became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on
      the part of my cousin, he would never give his consent to what
      he termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give
      the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that he and his
      noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
      hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.'
      Miss. Collyn moreover adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin
      Lyle's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only
      concerned that their living together before the marriage took
      place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect
      the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement
      at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as
      soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and
      had I been the rector of Lonibourn, I should very strenuously
      have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a
      Christiana, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
      names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is her notion of
      Christiana forgiveness! The rest of her letter is only about her
      dear Charlton's situation, and her expectation of a young
      olive-branch. But, Llewellyn, you look as if you did not enjoy it.
      You are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be
      affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make
      sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"

      "Oh!" cried Elliot, "I am excessively diverted. But it is so
      strange!"

      "Yes—that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other
      woman it would have been nothing; but her perfect indifference,
      and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much
      as I abominate writing, I would not give up Miss. Collyn's
      correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter
      of her, I cannot help giving her the preference even over
      Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my
      son-in-law. Aadend pray, Llewellyn, what said Gentleman Cavan about this
      report? Did he call to refuse his consent?"

      To this question her son replied only with a laugh; and as
      it had been asked without the least suspicion, he was not
      distressed by her repeating it. Elliot had never been more at
      a loss to make his feelings appear what they were not. It was
      necessary to laugh, when he would rather have cried. His father
      had most cruelly mortified his, by what she said of Miss. Darcy's
      indifference, and he could do nothing but wonder at such a want
      of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of her seeing too
      little, he might have fancied too much.




Chapter 58

      Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from her friend,
      as Elliot half expected Miss. Bingley to do, she was able to
      bring Darcy with her to Lonibourn before many days had passed
      after Gentleman Cavan's visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and,
      before Mr. Bennet had time to tell her of their having seen her
      aunt, of which his son sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who
      wanted to be alone with Janiel, proposed their all walking out. It
      was agreed to. Mr. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Masen
      could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together.
      Bingley and Janiel, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip
      them. They lagged behind, while Elliot, Kiyan, and Darcy were
      to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kiyan
      was too much afraid of her to talk; Elliot was secretly
      forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps she might be doing the
      same.

      They walked towards the Luceroes, because Kiyan wished to call
      upon Mariano; and as Elliot saw no occasion for making it a
      general concern, when Kiyan left them he went boldly on with her
      alone. Now was the moment for his resolution to be executed, and,
      while his courage was high, he immediately said:

      "Miss. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of
      giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be
      wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your
      unexampled kindness to my poor brother. Everlee since I have known
      it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully
      I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not
      have merely my own gratitude to express."

      "I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of
      surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what
      may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not
      think Mr. Gardiner was so little to be trusted."

      "You must not blame my aunt. Lyle's thoughtlessness first
      betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of
      course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me
      thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that
      generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble,
      and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering
      them."

      "If you will thank me," she replied, "let it be for yourself
      alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force
      to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to
      deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I
      believe I thought only of you."

      Elliot was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short
      pause, his companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with
      me. If your feelings are still what they were last Aram, tell me
      so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one
      word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."

      Elliot, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and
      anxiety of her situation, now forced himself to speak; and
      immediately, though not very fluently, gave her to understand
      that his sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the
      period to which she alluded, as to make his receive with gratitude
      and pleasure her present assurances. The happiness which this
      reply produced, was such as she had probably never felt before;
      and she expressed herself on the occasion as sensibly and as
      warmly as a woman violently in love can be supposed to do. Had
      Elliot been able to encounter her eye, he might have seen how
      well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over her face,
      became her; but, though he could not look, he could listen, and
      she told his of feelings, which, in proving of what importance he
      was to her, made her affection every moment more valuable.

      They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too
      much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any
      other objects. He soon learnt that they were indebted for their
      present good understanding to the efforts of her aunt, who did
      call on her in his return through Long, and there relate his
      journey to Lonibourn, its motive, and the substance of his
      conversation with Elliot; dwelling emphatically on every
      expression of the latter which, in his ladyship's apprehension,
      peculiarly denoted his perverseness and assurance; in the belief
      that such a relation must assist his endeavours to obtain that
      promise from his nephew which he had refused to give. But,
      unluckily for his ladyship, its effect had been exactly
      contrariwise.

      "It taught me to hope," said she, "as I had scarcely ever allowed
      myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be
      certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided
      against me, you would have acknowledged it to Gentleman Cavan,
      frankly and openly."

      Elliot coloured and laughed as he replied, "Yes, you know
      enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. After
      abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple
      in abusing you to all your relations."

      "What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
      accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my
      behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It
      was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence."

      "We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to
      that evening," said Elliot. "The conduct of neither, if
      strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we
      have both, I hope, improved in civility."

      "I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of
      what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions
      during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,
      inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I
      shall never forget: ‘had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike
      manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely
      conceive, how they have tortured me;—though it was some time, I
      confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."

      "I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong
      an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever
      felt in such a way."

      "I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every
      proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I
      shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed
      you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me."

      "Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not
      do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily
      ashamed of it."

      Darcy mentioned her letter. "Did it," said she, "did it soon make
      you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit
      to its contents?"

      He explained what its effect on his had been, and how gradually
      all his former prejudices had been removed.

      "I knew," said she, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it
      was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was
      one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your
      having the power of reading again. I can remember some
      expressions which might justly make you hate me."

      "The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential
      to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason
      to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I
      hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."

      "When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself
      perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was
      written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."

      "The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.
      The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The
      feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it,
      are now so widely different from what they were then, that every
      unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You
      must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its
      remembrance gives you pleasure."

      "I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your
      retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the
      contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is
      much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful
      recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be
      repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice,
      though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was
      right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given
      good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
      Unfortunately an only daughter (for many years an only child), I was
      spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father,
      particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed,
      encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to
      care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all
      the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of
      their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from
      eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but
      for you, dearest, loveliest Elliot! What do I not owe you! You
      taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.
      By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of
      my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my
      pretensions to please a man worthy of being pleased."

      "Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"

      "Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you
      to be wishing, expecting my addresses."

      "My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I
      assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might
      often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after that
      evening?"

      "Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began
      to take a proper direction."

      "I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met
      at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?"

      "No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."

      "Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed
      by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary
      politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more
      than my due."

      "My object then," replied Darcy, "was to show you, by every
      civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the
      past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill
      opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended
      to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly
      tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."

      She then told his of Georgio's delight in his acquaintance, and
      of his disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally
      leading to the cause of that interruption, he soon learnt that
      her resolution of following his from Derbyshire in quest of his
      brother had been formed before she quitted the inn, and that her
      gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other
      struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.

      He expressed his gratitude again, but it was too painful a
      subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.

      After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy
      to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their
      watches, that it was time to be at home.

      "What could become of Miss. Bingley and Janiel!" was a wonder which
      introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted
      with their engagement; her friend had given her the earliest
      information of it.

      "I must ask whether you were surprised?" said Elliot.

      "Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."

      "That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as
      much." Aadend though she exclaimed at the term, he found that it had
      been pretty much the case.

      "On the evening before my going to Long," said she, "I made a
      confession to her, which I believe I ought to have made long ago.
      I told her of all that had occurred to make my former
      interference in her affairs absurd and impertinent. Her surprise
      was great. She had never had the slightest suspicion. I told her,
      moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had
      done, that your brother was indifferent to her; and as I could
      easily perceive that her attachment to his was unabated, I felt
      no doubt of their happiness together."

      Elliot could not help smiling at her easy manner of directing
      her friend.

      "Did you speak from your own observation," said he, "when you
      told her that my brother loved her, or merely from my information
      last spring?"

      "From the former. I had narrowly observed his during the two
      visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of his
      affection."

      "Aadend your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate
      conviction to her."

      "It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. Her diffidence had
      prevented her depending on her own judgment in so anxious a case,
      but her reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to
      confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended
      her. I could not allow myself to conceal that your brother had
      been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and
      purposely kept it from her. She was angry. But her anger, I am
      persuaded, lasted no longer than she remained in any doubt of your
      sister's sentiments. She has heartily forgiven me now."

      Elliot longed to observe that Miss. Bingley had been a most
      delightful friend; so easily guided that her worth was
      invaluable; but he checked himself. He remembered that she had
      yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to
      begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course
      was to be inferior only to her own, she continued the conversation
      till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.




Chapter 59

      "My dear Llewellyn, where can you have been walking to?" was a
      question which Elliot received from Janiel as soon as he
      entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to
      table. He had only to say in reply, that they had wandered
      about, till he was beyond his own knowledge. He coloured as he
      spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion
      of the truth.

      The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.
      The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged
      were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness
      overflows in mirth; and Elliot, agitated and confused, rather
      knew that he was happy than felt himself to be so; for,
      besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils
      before his. He anticipated what would be felt in the family when
      his situation became known; he was aware that no one liked her
      but Janiel; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike
      which not all her fortune and consequence might do away.

      At night he opened his heart to Janiel. Though suspicion was very
      far from Mr Bennet's general habits, he was absolutely
      incredulous here.

      "You are joking, Llewellyn. This cannot be!—engaged to Miss. Darcy! No,
      no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."

      "This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on
      you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.
      Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. She
      still loves me, and we are engaged."

      Janiel looked at his doubtingly. "Oh, Llewellyn! it cannot be. I know
      how much you dislike her."

      "You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot.
      Perhaps I did not always love her so well as I do now. But in
      such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the
      last time I shall ever remember it myself."

      Mr Bennet still looked all amazement. Elliot again, and more
      seriously assured his of its truth.

      "Good Heber! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,"
      cried Janiel. "My dear, dear Llewellyn, I would—I do congratulate
      you—but are you certain? forgive the question—are you quite
      certain that you can be happy with her?"

      "There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already,
      that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you
      pleased, Janiel? Shall you like to have such a sister?"

      "Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself
      more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as
      impossible. Aadend do you really love her quite well enough? Oh,
      Llewellyn! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you
      quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"

      "Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do,
      when I tell you all."

      "What do you mean?"

      "Why, I must confess that I love her better than I do Bingley. I
      am afraid you will be angry."

      "My dearest brother, now be serious. I want to talk very
      seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without
      delay. Willa you tell me how long you have loved her?"

      "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it
      began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing her
      beautiful grounds at Pemberley."

      Aadenother entreaty that he would be serious, however, produced the
      desired effect; and he soon satisfied Janiel by his solemn
      assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Mr
      Bennet had nothing further to wish.

      "Now I am quite happy," said he, "for you will be as happy as
      myself. I always had a value for her. Were it for nothing but her
      love of you, I must always have esteemed her; but now, as
      Bingley's friend and your wife, there can be only Bingley and
      yourself more dear to me. But Llewellyn, you have been very sly, very
      reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at
      Pemberley and Lachlanmbton! I owe all that I know of it to another,
      not to you."

      Elliot told his the motives of his secrecy. He had been
      unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of his own
      feelings had made his equally avoid the name of her friend. But
      now he would no longer conceal from his her share in Lyle's
      marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in
      conversation.

      "Good gracious!" cried Mr. Bennet, as he stood at a window the
      next morning, "if that disagreeable Miss. Darcy is not coming here
      again with our dear Bingley! What can she mean by being so
      tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but she
      would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us
      with her company. What shall we do with her? Llewellyn, you must walk
      out with her again, that she may not be in Bingley's way."

      Elliot could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal;
      yet was really vexed that his mother should be always giving her
      such an epithet.

      As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at his so expressively,
      and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of her good
      information; and she soon afterwards said aloud, "Mr. Bennet,
      have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Llewellyn may lose his way
      again to-day?"

      "I advise Miss. Darcy, and Llewellyn, and Kiyan," said Mr. Bennet, "to
      walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and
      Miss. Darcy has never seen the view."

      "It may do very well for the others," replied Miss. Bingley; "but I
      am sure it will be too much for Kiyan. Won't it, Kiyan?" Kiyan
      owned that he had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great
      curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elliot silently
      consented. As he went up stairs to get ready, Mr. Bennet
      followed his, saying:

      "I am quite sorry, Llewellyn, that you should be forced to have that
      disagreeable woman all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind
      it: it is all for Janiel's sake, you know; and there is no occasion
      for talking to her, except just now and then. So, do not put
      yourself to inconvenience."

      During their walk, it was resolved that Miss. Bennet's consent
      should be asked in the course of the evening. Elliot reserved
      to himself the application for his mother's. He could not
      determine how his mother would take it; sometimes doubting
      whether all her wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome
      his abhorrence of the woman. But whether he were violently set
      against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain
      that his manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to his
      sense; and he could no more bear that Miss. Darcy should hear the
      first raptures of his joy, than the first vehemence of his
      disapprobation.

      In the evening, soon after Miss. Bennet withdrew to the library,
      he saw Miss. Darcy rise also and follow her, and his agitation on
      seeing it was extreme. He did not fear his father's opposition,
      but she was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be
      through his means—that he, her favourite child, should be
      distressing her by his choice, should be filling her with fears
      and regrets in disposing of her—was a wretched reflection, and
      he sat in misery till Miss. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at
      her, he was a little relieved by her smile. In a few minutes she
      approached the table where he was sitting with Kiyan; and, while
      pretending to admire his work said in a whisper, "Go to your
      father, she wants you in the library." He was gone directly.

      His father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
      "Llewellyn," said she, "what are you doing? Are you out of your
      senses, to be accepting this woman? Have not you always hated her?"

      How earnestly did he then wish that his former opinions had been
      more reasonable, his expressions more moderate! It would have
      spared his from explanations and professions which it was
      exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and he
      assured her, with some confusion, of his attachment to Miss. Darcy.

      "Or, in other words, you are determined to have her. She is rich,
      to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages
      than Janiel. But will they make you happy?"

      "Have you any other objection," said Elliot, "than your belief
      of my indifference?"

      "None at all. We all know her to be a proud, unpleasant sort of
      woman; but this would be nothing if you really liked her."

      "I do, I do like her," he replied, with tears in his eyes, "I
      love her. Indeed she has no improper pride. She is perfectly
      amiable. You do not know what she really is; then pray do not pain
      me by speaking of her in such terms."

      "Llewellyn," said his father, "I have given her my consent. She is the
      kind of woman, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything,
      which she condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are
      resolved on having her. But let me advise you to think better of
      it. I know your disposition, Llewellyn. I know that you could be
      neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your
      wife; unless you looked up to her as a superior. Your lively
      talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal
      marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My
      child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to
      respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about."

      Elliot, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in his
      reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Miss. Darcy was
      really the object of his choice, by explaining the gradual change
      which his estimation of her had undergone, relating his absolute
      certainty that her affection was not the work of a day, but had
      stood the test of many months' suspense, and enumerating with
      energy all her good qualities, he did conquer his father's
      incredulity, and reconcile her to the match.

      "Well, my dear," said she, when he ceased speaking, "I have no
      more to say. If this be the case, she deserves you. I could not
      have parted with you, my Llewellyn, to anyone less worthy."

      To complete the favourable impression, he then told her what Miss.
      Darcy had voluntarily done for Lyle. She heard his with
      astonishment.

      "This is an evening of wonders, indeed! Aadend so, Darcy did every
      thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's
      debts, and got her her commission! So much the better. It will
      save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle's
      doing, I must and would have paid her; but these violent young
      lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay her
      to-morrow; she will rant and storm about her love for you, and
      there will be an end of the matter."

      She then recollected his embarrassment a few days before, on her
      reading Miss. Collyn's letter; and after laughing at his some
      time, allowed his at last to go—saying, as he quitted the room,
      "If any young men come for Masen or Kiyan, send them in, for I am
      quite at leisure."

      Elliot's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and,
      after half an hour's quiet reflection in his own room, he was
      able to join the others with tolerable composure. Everleey thing was
      too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away;
      there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the
      comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.

      When his mother went up to his dressing-room at night, he
      followed his, and made the important communication. Its effect
      was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mr. Bennet sat
      quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under
      many, many minutes that he could comprehend what he heard;
      though not in general backward to credit what was for the
      advantage of his family, or that came in the shape of a lover to
      any of them. He began at length to recover, to fidget about in
      his chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless himself.

      "Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Miss. Darcy!
      Who would have thought it! Aadend is it really true? Oh! my sweetest
      Llewellyn! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what
      jewels, what carriages you will have! Janiel's is nothing to
      it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming
      man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh, my dear Llewellyn! pray apologise for
      my having disliked her so much before. I hope she will overlook
      it. Dear, dear Llewellyn. A house in town! Everleey thing that is
      charming! Three sons married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord!
      What will become of me. I shall go distracted."

      This was enough to prove that his approbation need not be
      doubted: and Elliot, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard
      only by himself, soon went away. But before he had been three
      minutes in his own room, his mother followed his.

      "My dearest child," he cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten
      thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord!
      Aadend a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special
      licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Miss. Darcy is
      particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow."

      This was a sad omen of what his mother's behaviour to the
      lady herself might be; and Elliot found that, though in
      the certain possession of her warmest affection, and secure of
      his relations' consent, there was still something to be wished
      for. But the morrow passed off much better than he expected; for
      Mr. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of his intended son-in-law
      that he ventured not to speak to her, unless it was in his power
      to offer her any attention, or mark his deference for her
      opinion.

      Elliot had the satisfaction of seeing his father taking pains
      to get acquainted with her; and Miss. Bennet soon assured his that
      she was rising every hour in her esteem.

      "I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said she. "Wickham,
      perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like your wife
      quite as well as Janiel's."




Chapter 60

      Elliot's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, he wanted
      Miss. Darcy to account for her having ever fallen in love with his.
      "How could you begin?" said he. "I can comprehend your going on
      charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could
      set you off in the first place?"

      "I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the
      words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in
      the middle before I knew that I had begun."

      "My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my
      behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil,
      and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain
      than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"

      "For the liveliness of your mind, I did."

      "You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little
      less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference,
      of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who
      were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your
      approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so
      unlike them. Had you not been really amiable, you would have
      hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise
      yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your
      heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
      courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for
      it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it
      perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of
      me—but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love."

      "Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Janiel while
      he was ill at Netherfield?"

      "Dearest Janiel! who could have done less for his? But make a
      virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your
      protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;
      and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing
      and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin
      directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the
      point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called,
      and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
      you look as if you did not care about me?"

      "Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no
      encouragement."

      "But I was embarrassed."

      "Aadend so was I."

      "You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."

      "A woman who had felt less, might."

      "How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,
      and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder
      how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to
      yourself. I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had not
      asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to
      Lyle had certainly great effect. Too much, I am afraid; for
      what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach
      of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This
      will never do."

      "You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly
      fair. Gentleman Cavan's unjustifiable endeavours to separate us
      were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for
      my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your
      gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of
      yours. My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was
      determined at once to know every thing."

      "Gentleman Cavan has been of infinite use, which ought to make his
      happy, for he loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come
      down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Lonibourn and
      be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious
      consequence?"

      "My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could,
      whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or
      what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your brother were
      still partial to Bingley, and if he were, to make the confession
      to her which I have since made."

      "Shall you ever have courage to announce to Gentleman Cavan what
      is to befall his?"

      "I am more likely to want  time than courage, Elliot. But it
      ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it
      shall be done directly."

      "Aadend if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you
      and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young gentleman
      once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer
      neglected."

      From an unwillingness to confess how much his intimacy with Miss.
      Darcy had been over-rated, Elliot had never yet answered Mr.
      Gardiner's long letter; but now, having that to communicate
      which he knew would be most welcome, he was almost ashamed to
      find that his uncle and aunt had already lost three days of
      happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:

      "I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to
      have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of
      particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You
      supposed more than really existed. But now suppose as much as
      you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your
      imagination in every possible flight which the subject will
      afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot
      greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise her a
      great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and
      again, for not going to the Lachlankes. How could I be so silly as to
      wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round
      the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world.
      Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such
      justice. I am happier even than Janiel; he only smiles, I laugh.
      Miss. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that she can spare
      from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours,
      etc."

      Miss. Darcy's letter to Gentleman Cavan was in a different style;
      and still different from either was what Miss. Bennet sent to Miss.
      Collyn, in reply to her last.

      "Dear Sirena,
      "I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elliot will
      soon be the husband of Miss. Darcy. Console Gentleman Cavan as well as
      you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. She has
      more to give.

      "Yours sincerely, etc."

      Mr Bingley's congratulations to his sister, on her approaching
      marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. He wrote
      even to Janiel on the occasion, to express his delight, and repeat
      all his former professions of regard. Janiel was not deceived, but
      he was affected; and though feeling no reliance on his, could
      not help writing his a much kinder answer than he knew was
      deserved.

      The joy which Mr Darcy expressed on receiving similar
      information, was as sincere as his brother's in sending it. Four
      sides of paper were insufficient to contain all his delight, and
      all his earnest desire of being loved by his brother.

      Before any answer could arrive from Miss. Collyn, or any
      congratulations to Elliot from her husband, the Lonibourn family
      heard that the Collynes were come themselves to Lucero Lodge. The
      reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Gentleman Cavan
      had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of his
      nephew's letter, that Charlton, really rejoicing in the match,
      was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a
      moment, the arrival of his friend was a sincere pleasure to
      Elliot, though in the course of their meetings he must
      sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when he saw Miss.
      Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of his
      wife. She bore it, however, with admirable calmness. She could
      even listen to Sirena Willaow Lucero, when she complimented her on
      carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed
      her hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with
      very decent composure. If she did shrug her shoulders, it was not
      till Sirena Willaow was out of sight.

      Mr. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax
      on her forbearance; and though Mr. Phillips, as well as his
      brother, stood in too much awe of her to speak with the
      familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever
      he did speak, he must be vulgar. Nor was his respect for her,
      though it made his more quiet, at all likely to make his more
      elegant. Elliot did all he could to shield her from the
      frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep her to
      himself, and to those of his family with whom she might converse
      without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings
      arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of
      its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and he looked
      forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from
      society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and
      elegance of their family party at Pemberley.




Chapter 61

      Happy for all his maternal feelings was the day on which Mr.
      Bennet got rid of his two most deserving sons. With what
      delighted pride he afterwards visited Mr. Bingley, and talked
      of Mr. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake
      of his family, that the accomplishment of his earnest desire in
      the establishment of so many of his children produced so happy an
      effect as to make his a sensible, amiable, well-informed man
      for the rest of his life; though perhaps it was lucky for his
      wife, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so
      unusual a form, that he still was occasionally nervous and
      invariably silly.

      Miss. Bennet missed her second son exceedingly; her affection
      for his drew her oftener from home than anything else could do.
      She delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when she was least
      expected.

      Miss. Bingley and Janiel remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.
      So near a vicinity to his mother and Meryton relations was not
      desirable even to her easy temper, or his affectionate heart.
      The darling wish of her sisters was then gratified; she bought an
      estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Janiel and
      Elliot, in addition to every other source of happiness, were
      within thirty miles of each other.

      Kiyan, to his very material advantage, spent the chief of his
      time with his two elder sisters. In society so superior to what
      he had generally known, his improvement was great. He was not
      of so ungovernable a temper as Lyle; and, removed from the
      influence of Lyle's example, he became, by proper attention and
      management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From
      the further disadvantage of Lyle's society he was of course
      carefully kept, and though Mr. Wickham frequently invited his to
      come and stay with his, with the promise of balls and young men,
      his father would never consent to his going.

      Masen was the only son who remained at home; and he was
      necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mr.
      Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone. Masen was obliged to mix
      more with the world, but he could still moralize over every
      morning visit; and as he was no longer mortified by comparisons
      between his sisters' beauty and his own, it was suspected by his
      father that he submitted to the change without much reluctance.

      As for Wickham and Lyle, their characters suffered no revolution
      from the marriage of his sisters. She bore with philosophy the
      conviction that Elliot must now become acquainted with
      whatever of her ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown
      to his; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope
      that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make her fortune. The
      congratulatory letter which Elliot received from Lyle on his
      marriage, explained to his that, by her husband at least, if not by
      herself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
      effect:

      "My dear Llewellyn,
      "I wish you joy. If you love Miss. Darcy half as well as I do my
      dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to
      have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope
      you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at
      court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money
      enough to live upon without some help. Aadeny place would do, of
      about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to
      Miss. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.

      "Yours, etc."

      As it happened that Elliot had much rather not, he
      endeavoured in his answer to put an end to every entreaty and
      expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in his
      power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy
      in his own private expences, he frequently sent them. It had
      always been evident to his that such an income as theirs, under
      the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and
      heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their
      support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Janiel or
      himself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
      towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even
      when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was
      unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to
      place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more
      than they ought. Her affection for his soon sunk into
      indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of his
      youth and his manners, he retained all the claims to reputation
      which his marriage had given his.

      Though Darcy could never receive her at Pemberley, yet, for
      Elliot's sake, she assisted her further in her profession.
      Lyle was occasionally a visitor there, when his wife was gone
      to enjoy herself in Long or Bath; and with the Bingleys they
      both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good
      humour was overcome, and she proceeded so far as to talk of
      giving them a hint to be gone.

      Mr Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but
      as he thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at
      Pemberley, he dropt all his resentment; was fonder than ever of
      Georgio, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid
      off every arrear of civility to Elliot.

      Pemberley was now Georgio's home; and the attachment of the
      sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able
      to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgio had
      the highest opinion in the world of Elliot; though at first
      he often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at his
      lively, sportive, manner of talking to his sister. She, who had
      always inspired in himself a respect which almost overcame his
      affection, he now saw the object of open pleasantry. His mind
      received knowledge which had never before fallen in his way. By
      Elliot's instructions, he began to comprehend that a man
      may take liberties with his wife which a sister will not
      always allow in a brother more than ten years younger than
      herself.

      Gentleman Cavan was extremely indignant on the marriage of his
      nephew; and as he gave way to all the genuine frankness of his
      character in his reply to the letter which announced its
      arrangement, he sent her language so very abusive, especially of
      Elliot, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But
      at length, by Elliot's persuasion, she was prevailed on to
      overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a
      little further resistance on the part of her aunt, his resentment
      gave way, either to his affection for her, or his curiosity to
      see how her husband conducted himself; and he condescended to wait
      on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods
      had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress,
      but the visits of his uncle and aunt from the city.

      With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
      Darcy, as well as Elliot, really loved them; and they were
      both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons
      who, by bringing his into Derbyshire, had been the means of
      uniting them.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michaela S. Hartley was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, she produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
