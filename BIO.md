# Short Bio

This project aims to subvert the expectations of heterosexual couples in romance novels by changing genders of main characters in famous romance novels (mostly from the Romantic era). By doing so, this project also comments on common romance novel tropes (e.g. the Byronic hero) and gender norms of the time.
